  <h2 class='c004'>BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Sometime in the month of July, 1812, nearly a
hundred years ago now, a well dressed, smooth
spoken man, less than thirty years of age, made his
appearance at Windsor, Nova Scotia. He was
looking for employment, but gave those who
enquired about his antecedents but little satisfaction,
further than he had recently come from England,
and could do almost anything in a mechanical way,
and was familiar also with farm work. He was
engaged under the name of Frederick Henry More
by a farmer named Bond, who resided in the village
of Rawden, and remained there about a year without
attracting unusual attention, except for his piety.
Elizabeth, the daughter of his employer, became
enamored with the stranger More and on March 12,
1813, they were married, much against the will of
her parents and friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>After his marriage More took up the occupations
of pedlar and tailor, which gave him an opportunity
to travel about the country and to make frequent
excursions to Halifax, where he appears first to
have turned his remarkable talent as a thief and
burglar to profitable account for upwards of a year
before he was detected. He escaped the clutches
of the law in Nova Scotia and reached St. John in
July, 1814. Less fortunate in his operations in
New Brunswick than he had been in Nova Scotia,
he was arrested and lodged in Kingston gaol on
July 24, 1814 on a charge of horse stealing, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>in those days was punishable by death. Here he
gave the name of Henry More Smith. Walter Bates
was then Sheriff of Kings county, and it is to him
that the public is indebted for the story of this
many-sided man, who was beyond all question the
most remarkable person ever confined in a New
Brunswick prison.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before he could be placed on trial Smith effected
his escape by an assumed illness, which deceived
even the doctor in attendance. Supposed to be
dying, he was left alone for a short while, jumped
from his supposed death bed and ran from the
prison, eluding his captors for nearly two months
before he was again landed in prison. On his
return to gaol he broke the chains, with which he
was secured, removed an iron collar which had
been rivetted about his neck and while loaded with
chains almost escaped by sawing the iron gratings
on the windows of his cell. All these performances
are vouched for by Sheriff Bates and Gaoler Dibble,
in whose custody he was, and attested by many of
the most prominent residents of Kingston a
century ago.</p>

<p class='c009'>The marionettes he made while feigning insanity,
after he had been sentenced to death, were the
wonder of hundreds who not only saw them, but
were present in his cell when he made them perform.
It was not so much the puppet show, which
caused astonishment, as that the puppets could be
made by a man whose only materials at hand were
the straw in his bed and strips torn from his
clothing; all made while he was handcuffed and
chained to the floor of his cell by heavy ox-chains.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Although convicted and sentenced to death
Smith was pardoned and escorted to St. John by
Sheriff Bates and placed on a schooner bound for
Windsor, his former home. This was on August
30, 1815, more than a year after his arrest.
Although he was within a few miles of the
residence of his wife it does not appear that he even
visited her, but after a short stay in Nova Scotia
left the province and made his appearance in
Maine. Occasional glimpses of his life in the
United States are given by Sheriff Bates in his
narrative, the most interesting of which occurred in
Connecticut, where he gave the authorities about as
much trouble as he did those of New Brunswick.
During his career he was heard of at points so
widely divergent as the Southern States and Upper
Canada. The last information of him was in what
is now the Province of Ontario nearly twenty years
after he had quitted Kingston, where he was still
plying his trade of theft.</p>

<p class='c009'>The story as told in subsequent pages by Sheriff
Bates is unique in criminal annals and is worthy of
careful perusal.</p>

Henry More Smith, the noted individual
who forms the subject of this narrative, made
his first appearance among us in the year
1812. Previous to this, we have no information
concerning him. Some time in the month of July,
in that year, he appeared at Windsor, in Nova Scotia,
looking for employment, and pretended to have
emigrated lately from England. On being asked
what his occupation was, he stated that he was a
tailor; but could turn his hand to any kind of
mechanical business or country employment. He
was decently clothed, genteel in his appearance,
and prepossessing in his manner, and seemed to
understand himself very well.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although an entire stranger, he seemed to be
acquainted with every part of the Province, but
studiously avoided to enter into close intimacy with
any person, associated with few, and carefully
concealed all knowledge of the means by which he
came to this country, and also of his origin and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>connections, keeping his previous life and history
in entire obscurity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finding no better employment he engaged in the
service of Mr. Bond, a respectable farmer in the
village of Rawden, who agreed with him for a month
on trial, during which time he conducted himself
with propriety and honesty; was industrious,
careful, and useful, to the entire satisfaction of
Mr. Bond, his employer, and even beyond his
expectations. He was perfectly inoffensive, gentle,
and obliging; using no intoxicating liquors, refrained
from idle conversation and all improper
language, and was apparently free from every evil
habit. Being engaged for some time in working
on a new road with a company of men, whose
lodging was in a camp, rather than subject himself
to the pain of their loose conversation in the camp
he chose to retire to some neighboring barn, as he
pretended, to sleep in quiet, and was always early
at work in the morning; but as the sequel will
discover, he was very differently engaged.</p>

<p class='c009'>A ready conformity to Mr. Bond’s religious
principles, who was a very religious man of the
Baptist persuasion, formed an easy yet successful
means for further ingratiating himself into the favor
of Mr. Bond and his family; his attendance on
morning and evening prayers was always marked
with regularity and seriousness; and in the absence
of Mr. Bond, he would himself officiate in the most
solemn and devout manner. This well directed aim
of his hypocrisy secured for him almost all he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>wish or expect from this family; he not only obtained
the full confidence of Mr. Bond himself, but gained
most effectually the affections of his favourite
daughter, who was unable to conceal the strength
of her attachment to him, and formed a resolution
to give her hand to him in marriage. Application
was made to Mr. Bond for his concurrence, and,
although a refusal was the consequence, yet so
strong was the attachment, and so firmly were they
determined to consummate their wishes, that neither
the advice, the entreaties, nor the remonstrances of
her friends, were of any avail. She went with him
from her father’s house to Windsor, and under the
name of Frederick Henry More, he there married
her on the 12th of March, 1813, her name having
been Elizabeth P.</p>

<p class='c009'>While he remained at Rawden, although he
professed to be a tailor, he did not pursue his
business; but was chiefly engaged in farming or
country occupations. After his removal to Windsor,
and his marriage to Miss Bond, he entered on a new
line of business, uniting that of the tailor and pedlar
together. In this character he made frequent visits
to Halifax, always bringing with him a quantity of
goods of various descriptions. At one time he was
known to bring home a considerable sum of money,
and upon being asked how he procured it and all
those articles and goods he brought home, he replied
that a friend by the name of Wilson supplied him
with anything he wanted as a tailor. It is remarkable,
however, that in all his trips to Halifax, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>uniformly set out in the forenoon and returned next
morning. A certain gentleman, speaking of him as
a tailor, remarked that he could cut very well and
make up an article of clothing in a superior manner.
In fact, his genius was extraordinary, and he could
execute anything well that he turned his attention
to. A young man having applied to him for a new
coat, he accordingly took his measure, and promised
to bring the cloth with him the first time he went
to Halifax. Very soon after he made his journey
to Halifax, and, on his return, happening to meet
with the young man, he showed him from his
portmanteau, the cloth, which was of a superior
quality, and promised to have it made up on a
certain day, which he punctually performed to the
entire satisfaction of his employer, who paid him
his price and carried off the coat.</p>

<p class='c009'>About this time a number of unaccountable and
mysterious thefts were committed in Halifax.
Articles of plate were missing from gentlemen’s
houses; silver watches and many other valuable
articles were taken from silversmith’s shops, and
all done in so mysterious a manner, that no marks
of the robber’s hands were to be seen. Three
volumes of late Acts of Parliament, relating to the
Court of Admiralty, were missing from the office of
Chief Justice Strange about the same time; he
offered a reward of three guineas to any person who
would restore them, with an assurance that no
questions would be asked. In a few days after,
Mr. More produced the volumes, which he said he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>had purchased from a stranger, and received the
three guineas reward without having to answer
any enquiries. This affair laid the foundation for
strong suspicions that Mr. More must have been
the individual who committed those secret and
mysterious thefts which produced so much astonishment
in various quarters; and, just at this crisis,
these suspicions received not only strong corroboration,
but were decidedly confirmed by the following
fact. While the young man whom he had
furnished with the new coat, as was previously
noticed, was passing through the streets of Halifax
with the coat on his back, he was arrested by a
gentleman who claimed the coat as his own, affirming
that it had been stolen from him some time since.
This singular affair, which to the young man was
extremely mortifying and afflictive, threw immediate
light upon all those secret and unaccountable
robberies. A special warrant was immediately
issued for the apprehension of More; however
before the warrant reached Rawden, he had made
his escape, and was next heard of as travelling on
horseback, with a portmanteau well filled with
articles which he offered for sale, as he proceeded
on his way by the River Philip; and early in the
month of July, 1814, he made his appearance in
Saint John, New Brunswick, by the name of Henry
More Smith. He did not, however, enter the City
with his horse, but put him up, and took lodgings
at the house of one Mr. Stackhouse, who resided in
a bye-place within a mile of the City, and came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>into the town upon foot. He found means to become
acquainted with the officers of the 99th Regiment,
who, finding him something of a military character,
and well acquainted with horsemanship, showed
him the stud of horses belonging to the regiment.
Smith, perceiving that the pair of horses which the
Colonel drove in his carriage did not match, they
being of different colors, and one of them black,
observed to the Colonel, that he knew of an excellent
black horse in Cumberland, that would match his
black one perfectly. The Colonel replied, that if
he were as good as his own, he would give fifty
pounds for him. Smith then proposed, that if he,
the Colonel, would advance him fifteen pounds, he
would leave his own horse in pledge, and take his
passage in a sloop bound for Cumberland, and
bring him the black horse. To this the Colonel
readily consented, and paid him down the fifteen
pounds. This opened the way to Smith for a most
flattering speculation; he had observed a valuable
mare feeding on the marsh contiguous to the place
where he had taken his lodgings, and cast his eye
upon a fine saddle and bridle belonging to Major
King, which he could put his hand on in the night.
With these facilities in view, Smith entered on his
scheme; he put himself in possession of the saddle
and bridle, determined to steal the mare he saw
feeding on the marsh, ride her to Nova Scotia, and
there sell her; then steal the black horse from
Cumberland, bring him to the Colonel, receive his
two hundred dollars, and without loss of time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>transport himself within the boundaries of the
United States.</p>

<p class='c009'>This scheme, so deeply laid, and so well concerted,
failed, however, of execution, and proved the
means of his future apprehension. Already in
possession of saddle and bridle, he spent most of the
night in fruitless efforts to take the mare, which was
running at large in the pasture. Abandoning this
part of his plan as hopeless, and turning his horse-stealing
genius in another direction, he recollected
to have seen a fine horse feeding in a field near the
highway as he passed through the Parish of Norton,
about thirty miles on, on his journey. Upon this
fresh scheme, he set off on foot, with the bridle and
saddle in the form of a pack on his back, passing
along all the succeeding day in the character of a
pedlar. Night came on, and put him in possession
of a fine black horse, which he mounted and rode
on in prosecution of his design, which he looked
upon now as already accomplished. But with all
the certainty of success, his object proved a failure,
and that through means which all his vigilance
could neither foresee nor prevent. From the want
of sleep the preceding night, and the fatigue of
travelling in the day, he became drowsy and
exhausted, and stopped in a barn belonging to
William Fairweather, at the bridge that crosses the
Millstream, to take a short sleep, and start again in
the night, so as to pass the village before daylight.
But, as fate would have it, he overslept; and his
horse was discovered on the barn floor in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>morning, and he was seen crossing the bridge by
daylight. Had he succeeded in crossing in the
night, he would in all probability have carried out
his design; for it was not till the afternoon of the
same day, that Mr. Knox the owner of the horse,
missed him from the pasture. Pursuit was
immediately made in quest of the horse, and the
circumstance of the robber having put him up at
the barn proved the means of restoring the horse to
his owner, and committing the robber to custody;
for there, at Mr. Fairweather’s, information was
given which directed the pursuit in the direct track.
Mr. Knox, through means of obtaining fresh horses
on the way, pursued him, without loss of time,
through the Province of Nova Scotia, as far as
Pictou, a distance of one hundred and seventy
miles, which the thief had performed with the
stolen horse in the space of three days. There, on
the 24th July, the horse having been stolen on the
20th, Mr. Knox had him apprehended by the Deputy
Sheriff, John Parsons, Esq., and taken before the
County Justices in Court then sitting. Besides the
horse, there were a watch and fifteen guineas found
with the prisoner; and a warrant was issued by the
Court for his conveyance through the several
Counties to the gaol of Kings County, Province of
New Brunswick, there to take his trial. Mr. Knox
states that he, the prisoner, assumed different
names, and committed several robberies by the
way; that a watch and a piece of Indian cotton
were found with him and returned to the owners;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>that on the way to Kingston gaol he made several
attempts to escape from the Sheriff, and that but
for his own vigilance he never would have been able
to reach the prison with hint, observing at the same
time, that unless he were well taken care of and
secured, he would certainly make his escape. He
was received into prison for examination on the
warrant of conveyance without a regular commitment.</p>

The prisoner had rode all day in the rain,
and having had no opportunity of changing
his clothes, which by this time had
become very wet, it was thought necessary, lest he
should sustain injury, to put him into the debtors’
room, handcuffed, where he could have all opportunity
of warming and drying himself at the fire;
the stove having been out of repair in the criminal’s
room. The day following he was removed into the
criminal’s room, where irons were considered
unnecessary; and, as he appeared quite peaceable,
his handcuffs were taken off, and being furnished
with a comfortable berth, he seemed reconciled to
his situation.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 13th of August I received the following
letter from the Clerk of the Circuit Court:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,—Mr. Knox has left with me the

before the Magistrates in your County and examined
and the examination committed to writing. I do
not know under what warrant he is in your custody;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>but I think it would be as well for the same Magistrates
to make out a Mitimus after the examination,
as it would be more according to form.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>After proper notice, Judge Pickett, Mr. Justice
Ketchum, and Mr. Knox, all attended his examinations;
in the course of which he said his name was
Henry More Smith, twenty years of age, came from
England on account of the war, had been in America
about a year and a half, that he was born in Brighton,
that his father and mother were living there now,
and that he expected them out to Halifax the ensuing
spring; that he purchased a farm for them on
the River Philip, and had written for them to come.
He also stated that he came to St. John on business,
where he fell in with Colonel Daniel, of the 99th
Regiment, who proposed to give him two hundred
dollars if he would bring him a black horse, within
a fortnight, that would span with his own of the
same color, that he told the Colonel that he knew
one that would match his perfectly, and that if he
would lend him fifteen guineas, he would leave his
own mare in pledge until he would bring the horse,
as he knew there was a vessel then in St. John bound
to Cumberland, where the horse was. To this
proposal he said the Colonel agreed, and having
received the money and left the mare, went to his
lodgings; but before he could return, the vessel
had left him; and having no other conveyance by
water, he was obliged to set out on foot; and having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>a long journey to travel, and but short time to perform
it in, he travelled all night, and at daylight
was overtaken by a stranger with a large horse and
a small mare, which he offered for sale, and that he
being weary with walking all night, offered him ten
pounds for the mare, which he accepted. That they
continued their journey some time, and began to find
out that the mare would not answer his purpose; the
horse being a good looking one, which he might sell
again for the money, he bantered the stranger for
a swap, which was effected by giving the mare and
fifteen pounds in exchange for the horse, saddle and
bridle. He then produced a receipt which he said
the stranger gave him, to the following effect:</p>

<p class='c013'>Received, July 20, 1814, of Henry More Smith,
fifteen pounds, in swap of a horse between a small
mare and a large horse, I let him have, with a star,
six or seven years old.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>James Churman.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He then stated that he proceeded on to Cumberland,
and bargained for the black horse which was
the object of his pursuit; and not having money
enough to pay for him, without selling the one he
rode, and hearing that Captain Dixon, of Truro,
wanted to purchase such a horse, and finding that
he, Captain Dixon, had gone on to Pictou, forty miles
further, to attend Court, he was obliged to follow
him with all speed. That the next day being Sunday,
he was obliged to wait till Monday to sell his
horse, and was there apprehended by Mr. Knox and
charged with stealing his horse; that he was taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>before the Court, and had all his money, his watch,
and his horse, taken from him, and was sent back
to King’s County gaol to take his trial; and complained,
that as he was an entire stranger, and had
no one to speak for him, unless the man was taken
who sold him the horse, his case might be desperate,
for he had neither friends nor money, nor any one
who knew him to take his part. He complained also
of having been badly used by Mr. Knox on the way.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having been asked by Mr. Knox, in the course
of his examination what occupation he followed in
the country, he replied, “No one in particular.”
Mr. Knox then hastily asked him how he got his
living. He replied, with great firmness and self-possession,
“By my honesty, Sir.” After this
examination a regular commitment was made out,
and he returned to prison. He submitted to his
confinement without a murmur, and with much
seeming resignation; but complained of great pain
in his side occasioned by cold he had received. He
seemed anxious for an opportunity to send for his
portmanteau, which he had said he had left with
some other articles in the care of Mr. Stackhouse near
Saint John. The portmanteau, he said, contained
his clothes, which he would be obliged to sell to raise
money for the purpose of procuring necessaries and
engaging a lawyer, repeating again, that, as he was
a stranger and had no friends to help him, there
would be but little chance for him, though innocent,
except the thief who stole the horse was taken and
brought to justice.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>It so happened, on the day following, that I had
occasion to go to the City of Saint John in company
with Dr. Adino Paddock, senr., when, on our way,
he had occasion to call at Mr. Nathaniel Golding’s
tavern, in Hampton; and while placing our horses
under his shed, we perceived a man mounting a
horse in great haste, that was standing at the steps
of the door, who immediately rode off with all
possible speed, as though he were in fear of being
overtaken. On inquiring who he was, we were
informed by Mrs. Golding that he was a stranger
who had called there once or twice before, and that
she believed his name was Chuman or Churman.
I observed to the Doctor that that was the name of
the man from whom the prisoner, Smith, said he
purchased the horse; upon which Mrs. Golding said
that she could ascertain that by inquiring in the
other room, which she was requested to do, and was
answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p class='c009'>We made frequent inquiries by the way, as we
proceeded towards Saint John, but could ascertain
nothing further of the stranger by that name.
After my return from Saint John I informed the
prisoner, Smith, of what happened by the way; he
appeared exceedingly elated with the idea of his
being the man that had sold him the horse, and said
that if he had money or friends he could have him
taken and brought to justice, and would soon be
restored to liberty again himself; but that if he were
suffered to make his escape out of the country, his
own case would be deplorable indeed, though he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>was innocent. He again reiterated his complaint,
that he was destitute of money and friends, in a
strange country, although anxious to employ a
lawyer, he did not know of any to whom he could
apply for advice. He was recommended to Charles
J. Peters, Esq., attorney, in St. John, with the
assurance, that if there were any possibility in the
case of getting him clear, Mr. Peters would exert
himself in his behalf most faithfully. The first
opportunity that offered, he sent an order to Mr.
Stackhouse for his portmanteau, with instructions
to apply the proceeds of certain articles, which he
had left him for sale, if disposed of, in retaining Mr.
Peters as his attorney. The return brought a
handsome portmanteau and a pair of boots, leaving
a small sum in the hands of Mr. Peters, as part of
his retainer, which was to be increased to five
guineas before the sitting of the court. This
arrangement seemed to be productive of much
satisfaction to the prisoner, and for the purpose of
fulfilling the engagement with Mr. Peters, he
expressed a desire to dispose of the contents of his
portmanteau, as far as it was necessary for making
up the sum. He gave me the key, with which I
opened his portmanteau, and found it well filled
with various articles of valuable clothing; two or
three genteel coats, with vests and pantaloons, of the
first quality and cut; a superior top-coat of the
latest fashion, faced with black silk, with silk
stockings and gloves and a variety of books, consisting
of a neat pocket-bible and prayer-book, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>London Gazetteer, a Ready Reckoner, and several
other useful books. He had also a night and day
spy-glass of the best kind, and a small magnifying
glass in a tortoise-shell case, with many other useful
articles. Suspicions of his not having come
honestly by the contents of his portmanteau was
not the impression that was made; but rather that
he had been handsomely and respectably fitted out
by careful and affectionate parents, anxious for his
comfort and happiness, and that he was, in all
probability, innocent of the charge alleged against
him. He soon commenced selling off his little stock,
and for the purpose of affording him a facility,
persons, wishing to purchase from him, were permitted
to come to the wicket door, through which
he could make his bargain, and dispose of his things.
He never failed to endeavor to excite the pity of
those who came to visit him, by representing his
deplorable situation, he being reduced to the
necessity of selling his clothes to raise the means
of defending his innocence in a strange country from
the unfortunate charge preferred against him. Nor
did he fail of his purpose, for many, from pure
sympathy for his unfortunate situation purchased
from him, and paid him liberally. Among those who
came to see there was a young man, who said
he had known the prisoner in St. John and professed
to visit him from motives of friendship; he had
access to him through the grates of the window, and
some of the glass being broken, he could hold free
conversation through the grates. The last time he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>came he carried off the night and day glass for debt
which he said he owed him while in St. John; but
the probability was that he had given him a watch
in exchange.</p>

<p class='c009'>The prison was then kept by Mr. Walter Dibble,
a man of learning and talents, who for several years
had been afflicted with a painful disease, so that for
a great part of the time, he was confined to the
house, and frequently to his room, in the County
Court House, where he taught a school, by which
means, together with the fees and perquisites of
the jail and court house, afforded him a comfortable
living for himself and family, consisting of his wife
and daughter, and one son named John, about
nineteen years of age, who constantly attended his
father. It may be also necessary to mention that
Mr. Dibble was one of the principal members of the
Masonic Lodge held at Kingston, and was in high
esteem among them; besides he was regarded by all
who knew him as a man of honesty and integrity,
and well worthy to fill any situation of responsibility
or trust. I am induced to advert to those particulars
of Mr. Dibble’s character because I am indebted
to him for many of the particulars relative to the
prisoner, and because, having had a person who
could be relied on, there was less necessity for my
visiting the prisoner very frequently, which did not
exceed once a week generally, except upon special
occasions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shortly after the commitment of the prisoner he
was visited by Lieutenant Baxter, an officer of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>New Brunswick Regiment, then recruiting at
Kingston. The officer proposed to the prisoner to
enlist him, as a means by which he might be
released from his confinement. The idea he spurned
with contempt, and chose rather to await the issue
of his trial, depending on his professed innocence
of the crime for which he stood committed. He was,
however, prevailed on to write to his attorney on
the subject, and received for his answer that such a
measure was inadmissible, and advised him to
content himself and await the issue of his trial.
He appeared much displeased with the abruptness
of his attorney’s answer, and seemed rather to look
upon this short and summary reply, as an indication
of his displeasure with him, and as an omen that
he, his attorney, would not interest himself much
in his behalf.</p>

<p class='c009'>About this time, Sept. 7th, I received a letter from
the Clerk of the Circuit Court inclosing a Precept
to summon a Court of Oyer and Terminer and
General Gaol Delivery, to be held at Kingston, on
Tuesday, the 27th of September. On the approach
of the period for his trial, he was encouraged by his
friends to rely with full confidence on his attorney,
with repeated assurances that he would give his
case all possible attention: but with all his professed
ignorance of the law, (and this ignorance he had
often declared with apparent simplicity), the
prisoner knew too much of it to resign himself with
confidence to the issue of a cause which could
promise him nothing but conviction, and confirm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>his guilt. He therefore, upon his professed dissatisfaction
with his attorney, appeared to think
no more about him, not to renew his enquiries
concerning him, but set about a more summary
method of extricating himself from the power of the
law. He turned his attention to the Bible, and
perused it with an air of much seriousness, as
though the concerns of the unseen world engrossed
all his thoughts; he behaved himself in every
respect with becoming propriety, and his whole
demeanor was such as to engage much interest in
his behalf.</p>

<p class='c009'>About this time he discovered symptoms of a
severe cold, being troubled with a hollow sounding
cough, and complained of a pain in the side, but
still submitted to his confinement without a murmur
or complaint. He would frequently advert to the
ill usage which he said he had received by the way
from Pictou, after he was made prisoner, particularly
of a blow in the side with a pistol, given by Mr. Knox,
which felled him to the ground, as he expressed it,
like a dead man; that when he had recovered his
respiration which had been for some time suspended,
he raised blood, and continued to raise blood
occasionally by the way for two or three days; that
the pain had never left him since, and was, as he
believed, approaching to a gathering in the inside,
which he feared would finally prove fatal to him.
He showed a bruised spot on his side which was
swelled and much discolored, and apparently very
painful. All this was accompanied with loss of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>appetite and increased feebleness of body; but he
still discovered a remarkable resignation to his fate.
His situation was such as to excite sympathy and
feeling, so that an endeavor was made to render him
as comfortable as possible, by keeping his apartment
properly tempered with heat, and providing him
with such food as was adapted to the delicacy of his
constitution.</p>

<p class='c009'>His disease, however, continued to increase, and
his strength to decline, with all the symptoms of
approaching dissolution; pain in the head and eyes,
dizziness, with sickness at the stomach, frequent
raising of blood, and of increased painfulness of the
contusion on his side. It was now considered high
time to apply to a physician, and on the 11th of
September I sent for a doctor, who examined his side,
and the general state of his disease, and gave him
some medicine. On the 12th, he appeared a little
better. Thirteenth, at evening, grew worse. Fourteenth,
unable to walk,—very high fever, with
frequent chills of ague. Fifteenth, vomiting and
raising blood more frequently. Sixteenth, the
Rev. Mr. Scovil visited him in the morning, found
him very ill, and sent him toast and wine and some
other cordials. Same day the doctor attended him
at 3 o’clock, and gave him medicine. At 6 o’clock, no
better, and vomiting whatever he took. Eighteenth,
appeared still to grow worse; was visited by Judge
Pickett and several other neighbors, and being asked
whether he wanted anything, or what he could take,
answered “nothing, except an orange or a lemon.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Nineteenth, appeared to decline very fast; at 2
o’clock, was visited by the doctor, who said the man
must be removed out of that room, that he was too
ill to be kept there, and that it was of no use to give
him medicine in so damp a place. Twentieth, in the
morning, found him still declining; at ten o’clock,
Mr. Thaddeus Scribner and others went in to see
him, inspecting the room, but found no dampness
that could injure even a sick man taking medicine.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Rev. Mr. Scovil visited him in the afternoon,
and introduced the subject of his approaching end.
The prisoner conversed freely on the subject, and
expressed his conviction that there was little or no
hope of his recovery. He stated to Mr. Scovil that
he was born in England, that his parents were
formerly attached to the Church of England, but
had lately joined the Methodists; that he came from
England, on account of the war, and that he
expected his parents to come to the country next
spring, which last circumstance seemed to excite
in him strong emotions. Twenty-first, the Rev.
Mr. Scovil with others of the neighborhood visited
him in the morning; no favorable symptoms.
Twenty-second, the prisoner very low; violent
fever, accompanied with chills and ague. Inflammation
of the bowels, with evacuations of blood for
the last two days, extremities cold, and strength
greatly reduced, insomuch that he could only
just articulate above his breath. Was understood
to say, that he should die for want of medical
assistance, as the doctor had refused to attend him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>any more in that place, and the sheriff refused to
remove him.</p>

<p class='c009'>His situation had by this time excited general
sympathy and pity; his seeming simplicity,
passiveness and resignation, greatly contributing to
produce the effect. At 6 o’clock, Rev. Mr. Scovil
and a great number of the neighbors came and sat
with him till ten o’clock, and then left him with
the impression that he would not live till morning.
Friday, 23rd, went to the gaol early in the morning,
found the prisoner lying on the floor, naked, and
seemingly in great distress; said he had fallen
through pain and weakness, and could not get up
again. He was taken up and carried to his bed;
appeared as though he would instantly expire;
continued in a low and almost lifeless state till
5 o’clock in the afternoon, when he appeared to all
present to be really dying. Rev. Mr. Scovil, Mr.
Perkins, Mr. G. Raymond, all near neighbors, and
Mr. Eddy, from Saint John, who happened to be in
Kingston at the time, all supposed him to be in the
agonies of death. He fell into a state of insensibility,
and continued so until a phial of hartshorn
was brought from an adjoining room, the application
of which seemed to revive him a little.</p>

<p class='c009'>After some time he recovered so far as to be able
to articulate, and upon its being observed to him
that he had a fit, he replied that he was sensible of
it, and that it was his <i>family infirmity</i>, and that
many of his connections had died in the same way;
and further remarked that he did not think he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>could survive another, which would probably come
upon him about the same time next day; that he
was sensible he should not recover; but that God
would have him. He then asked Mr. Scovil to pray
with him; his desire was complied with, and
prayer offered up in the most solemn and devout
manner; the occasion was deeply affecting, and all
departed with the full conviction, that the patient
would not linger till the morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Previous to this, no regular watchers had
attended him; but it was now considered highly
necessary that some persons should sit with him till
the morning; consequently John Dibble and
Charles Cambreau were appointed by the sheriff to
watch him through the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning the following letter was
dispatched to Mr. Peters, the prisoner’s attorney:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>:—I fear we shall be disappointed in
our expectations of the trial of the prisoner, More
Smith, at the approaching Court, as I presume from
appearance, he will be removed by death before
that time. He is dying in consequence of a blow
that he received, as he says, from Mr. Knox, with a
pistol, which he has regularly complained of since
he has been in gaol, and is now considered past
recovery. As it will be a matter of enquiry, and
new to me, I will thank you to let me know by the
bearer what would be the necessary steps for me to
take; and not fail, as I have but little hopes of his
continuing till morning.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours, &amp;c.,</div>
      <div class='line in12'><span class='sc'>Walter Bates</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The return of the bearer brought the following:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span><span class='sc'>St. John</span>, Sept. 24th,—Dear Sir,—Your favor
of yesterday I received this morning, and I am
sorry to hear so desponding an account of the
unfortunate man in your custody. It will be your
duty, I conceive, to have a Coroner’s inquest on the
body, and then have it decently interred. With
respect to the cause of the death, that is a circumstance
which must rest wholly on facts; if any
physician shall attend him, let him be particular in
taking down in writing what the man says in his
last moments, as to the circumstances; and if a
Justice should be then present, it would not be
amiss.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In haste, yours, sincerely,</div>
      <div class='line in24'><span class='sc'>C. J. Peters</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Saturday, 24th.—The watchers reported that he
had passed a very restless night, and but just
survived the morning; that he complained for
want of medical assistance. The following note
was then sent to the doctor who had attended him:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Kingston</span>, September 24th, 1814,—Dear Doctor:
Smith, the prisoner, says that he is suffering for
want of medical assistance, and that you will not
attend him unless he is removed into another room,
which cannot be permitted; he must take his fate
where he now is, and if he dies in gaol, an enquiry
will take place which may prove to your disadvantage.
I must therefore request your attention.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c014'>
    <div>I am yours, &amp;c.,</div>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. A. Paddock, Jr</span>.      <span class='sc'>Walter Bates</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>At this time the sympathy and compassion of the
whole neighborhood was excited to the highest
degree. The family of the Rev. Mr. Scovil,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>especially manifested deep concern for him, and
sent him everything that they thought would either
comfort or relieve him; as did also the family of
Mr. Perkins, and that of Mr. Raymond; all these
having been in the immediate neighborhood. But
the prisoner used little or none of their cordials or
delicacies. Mr. Perkins visited him about 10
o’clock, a.m., and kindly proposed to watch with
him the ensuing night, for which he discovered
much thankfulness. In the course of the day the
doctor came, and gave him some medicine; but
found him so weak, that he required to be lifted
and supported while he was receiving it. The
doctor acknowledged his low state, but did not
think him so near his end, as to die before morning,
unless he should go off in a fit. This, the patient
said, was what he had reason to fear would be his
fate before morning, and therefore wished to make
his will.</p>

<p class='c009'>All his clothes, at his death, he willed to John
Dibble; and his money, about three pounds, which
he always kept by him in his berth, he bequeathed
to the jailor, for his kind attention to him in his
sickness. The money Mr. Dibble proposed to take
charge of; but Smith said it was safe where it was
for the present.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. N. Perkins having had occasion to call that
day on Mr. W. H. Lyon, was enquired of by him
concerning the state of the prisoner. Mr. Perkins
informed him that he was alive when he left him;
but thought he would be dead before night. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>information Mr. Lyon communicated the same
evening to a number of persons who were assembled
at the house of Mr. Scribner, and added that he
was dead, for that while he was on his way to
Mr. Scribner’s, (it having been in the dusk of the
evening,) he had seen <i>Smith’s Ghost</i> pass by him at
a short distance off, without touching the ground.
This singular report, as it came from a quarter that
could not be well disputed, very much alarmed the
whole company, and formed the subject of their
conversation for the evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>But return to our narrative. After the prisoner
had made his will, he was, for a short time, left
alone, with the probability that he would shortly be
seized by another fit, which he was not expected to
survive. About 6 o’clock in the evening, the Rev.
Mr. Scovil observed to his family, that it was then
about the same hour of the day at which Smith had
had his fit on the day preceding; that he thought
he would die suddenly; he would therefore walk
over to the Court House and be ready there at the
time, as it must be unpleasant for Mr. Dibble to be
alone. This so much awakened the sensibilities of
Mrs. Scovil, that she could not bear the reflection,
that a child of parents that were perhaps respectable,
should be so near her, in a strange country, sick
and dying, on a bed of straw. She therefore called
Amy, her wench. “Here,” said she, “take this
feather bed, and carry it to the gaol, and tell
Mr. Dibble that I have sent it for Smith to die on.”
Mr. Scovil had been in the house, and seated with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Mr. Dibble but a very short time, when a noise was
heard from Smith in the gaol. John Dibble, who
constantly attended on him, ran in haste, unlocked
the prison door, found him in the agonies of a fit,
and almost expiring. He made an effort to speak,
and begged John to run and heat a brick that was
near, and apply it to his feet, to give him one
moment’s relief while he was dying, for that his
feet and legs were already cold and dead to the
knees. John, willing to afford what relief he could
to the dying man, ran in great haste from the gaol
through the passage round the stairway that led to
the kitchen, where was a large fire of coals, into
which he cast the brick, waited but a few minutes,
and returned with the heated brick to the prison;
but to his indiscribable astonishment, and almost
unwilling to believe the evidence of his senses, the
dying man had disappeared, and could not be
found!!! John ran with the tidings to his father
and the Rev. Mr. Scovil, who were sitting in a room
which the prisoner must have passed in his
escape. They were entirely incredulous to the
report of an affair so unparalleled, and would not
yield their belief until they searched every corner
of the apartment themselves, and found that Smith
had not only effected his escape, but had also carried
his money, his boots, and every article of clothing
away with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is impossible to conceive or describe the feeling
of astonishment with which every one about the
house was filled, when they found that the man, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>had been groaning and agonizing under the pain
of an accumulation of diseases, which night after
night, seemed to have been wasting his strength,
and bringing him nearer the close of his unhappy
life—had, in a moment, and the very moment
which was thought to be his last, seized the
opportunity of his prison door being open, and
rushed from his confinement, leaving not a vestige
of his moveables behind him. As soon as a search
through the prison confirmed the fact of the elopement,
the inmates hastened outside, and continued
their search around the premises. At this moment,
Amy, the wench, made her appearance, carrying
the feather bed; and seeing the people around the
house said to them: “Misses send this bed for Smit
to die on.” Her master told her to take it home,
and tell her mistress that Smith was gone. Amy
ran home and told her mistress that massa say Smit
dead and gone—he no want im bed! “Ah!”
exclaimed her mistress, “poor man, is he dead?
Then, Amy, you may run and carry this shirt and
winding sheet, to lay Smith out in.” Amy instantly
obeyed, and told her master accordingly. “You
may take them back,” said he, “Smith is gone!”
“Where he gone, massa?” “I don’t know,” said
he, “except the devil has taken him off!” Amy
hastened back to her mistress, and told her that
“massa say Smit be dead and gone, and the devil
has taken him away!” So much was the mind of
every one prepared to hear of his death, that the
expression, “Smith is gone!” served to convey no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>other idea. The sheriff himself, who had not been
present, and did not hear of the affair immediately,
gave the sentence the same interpretation. A
messenger having been dispatched to him with the
tidings, met him on his way to the gaol, expecting
to witness the last moments of the patient. On
being informed by the messenger that “Smith was
gone,” “Ah poor fellow,” he exclaimed, “I expected
it.” “What time did he die?” “But he is gone
clear off.” “It is impossible,” rejoined the Sheriff,
“that he can be far from his sick bed.” “Why,”
replied the messenger, “they were all about the
gaol looking for him, and no one could tell which
way he had gone.” “Unparalleled and abominable
deception!” replied the sheriff. “How did he get
out of gaol!” He believed John Dibble left the
door open while he ran to beat a brick, and then
Smith made his escape.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was to us the first development of the true
character of Henry More Smith, and thus, by means
of a counterfeit illness, which melted the feelings
and drew the sympathies of the whole neighborhood;
which baffled every power of detection, and
imposed even upon the physician himself, did this
accomplished villain effect his release, and was now
again running at large, glorying in the issue of his
scheme.</p>

But before we pursue his history in his
succeeding adventures, it may be necessary,
for those who are unacquainted with the
local situation of the gaol, from which the prisoner
made his escape, to give a short description of it.
Kingston is situated on a neck or tongue of land,
formed by the River Saint John, and Bellisle Bay,
running north-east and south-west on the western
side of the neck, and by the Kennebeccasis running
the same course on the western side, leaving a
tract of land between the two rivers about five miles
in breadth and thirty miles in length.</p>

<p class='c009'>The winter road from Fredericton, the seat of
Government, to the City of Saint John crosses
the land at Kingston to the Kennebeccasis, and
this road is inhabited on both sides. The
road is intersected in the center of Kingston by
another road running northeasterly to the head of
Bellisle Bay, and is also inhabited on both sides, at
the intersection of these roads; on an eminence,
stands the Court house (under which is the prison)
and church, facing each other, east and west, at a
distance of about eight rods. At the distance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>about ten rods from the gaol stands the house of Mr.
F. N. Perkins, to the north, and at an equal distance
to the south the house of the Rev. E. Scovil is
situated, with various other houses in different
directions; the land clear all around to a considerable
distance, affording no hiding place. From a
prison thus situated and surrounded with dwelling-houses,
did our hero escape, without any eye having
seen him, and leaving no mark nor track behind
which could direct in the pursuit of him. Finding
ourselves unable to pursue in any certain direction,
our conclusions were that he must either have taken
the road to Saint John or that leading to Nova Scotia
the way by which he came, and the only road he
was known to be acquainted with. Accordingly
men were dispatched in pursuit of him on the Saint
John road, and others sent to the different ferries,
while I myself, with Mr. Moses Foster, the deputy
sheriff, took the road toward Nova Scotia, with all
speed, in the night, and rode on until we began to
think that we must have passed him. Having
arrived at a house which he could not well pass
without being seen, we stationed watchers there,
and also set watchers in other stations, and maintained
a close lookout all night, but to no purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>At daylight I furnished Mr. Foster with money,
and sent him on upon the same road with directions
to proceed as far as Mr. McLeod’s tavern, distance
forty miles, and in case of hearing nothing of him,
to discontinue the pursuit and return. At the same
time I returned to Kingston myself, where I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>informed towards evening, that a man, who
answered his description had crossed the ferry over
Bellisle Bay the evening before in great haste,
stating that he was going on an express to Fredericton,
and must be there by ten o’clock the next
morning. This, compared with Mr. Lyon’s story,
the reader will recollect, of having seen Smith’s
<i>ghost</i> or apparition the same evening in the twilight,
confirmed the opinion that we had now got upon
the direction of our runaway. And when we
remember further, that the <i>apparition</i> was passing
without <i>touching the ground</i>, we will have some
idea of the rapidity with which our self-released
hero was scudding along as he carried his neck from
the halter. It was now Sunday evening, and he
had twenty-four hours of a start, leaving little
hopes of his being overtaken by me. As my only
alternative, I forwarded advertisements, and proposed
a reward of twenty dollars for his apprehension
and re-commitment to custody; but with very little
prospect of success knowing that he was escaping
for his life, and would succeed in getting out of the
country before he would be overtaken.</p>

<p class='c009'>Monday morning, the 26th instant, Mr. Moses
Foster returned from his route, and by this time
many unfavorable reports concerning the prisoner’s
escape had begun to be circulated. The Court
at which he was to receive his trial was now to
meet on the Tuesday following, and a jury summoned
from different parts of the county for the
express purpose of trying the horse-stealer.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>My whole time and attention were now required
to make the necessary preparations for the Court,
and I felt myself not a little chagrined on reflecting
on the circumstances in which I was placed. This
feeling became heightened to a painful degree when
I came to understand, by Mr. E. Jones, that the
villain, instead of escaping for his life, and getting
out of my reach with all possible haste, had only
travelled about ten miles the first night, and was
seen lying on some straw before the barn of Mr.
Robert Bailes, the next morning, on the road to
Gagetown, having lain there till 12 o’clock in the
day. But Smith did not lie on his bed of straw for
rest merely; even there he was projecting fresh
schemes of villainy, waiting for an opportunity to
carry away some booty from the house of Mr. Bailes;
and so it happened that he did not miss his aim, for
Mr. and Mrs. Bailes had occasion to leave the house
to go some distance, leaving the door unlocked,
when the robber entered, broke open a trunk and
carried off a silver watch, eight dollars in money, a
pair of new velvet pantaloons, and a pocket-book,
with several other articles. He then walked leisurely
on his way, stopping at the next house and at all
the houses that were contiguous to the road, so that
he did not make more than three or four miles
before dark.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Mr. Bailes returned to his house and found
it had been robbed, he immediately fixed his
suspicion on the man who had lain before the barn
door, from having observed the print of a boot heel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>which was thought to be his, and gave the alarm to
his neighbours. They immediately set out in
pursuit of him, and having heard that he had been
seen on the road at no great distance before
them, they followed on in high spirits, expecting
shortly to seize him; but in this they were
disappointed, for the robber warily turned aside
from the road, leaving his pursuers to exercise a
painful and diligent search, without being able to
ascertain which way he had gone. Having followed
as far as Gagetown, they posted up advertisements,
descriptive of his person, and also of the watch;
and sent some of them on to Fredericton.</p>

<p class='c009'>Late on Sunday night, a man called at the house
of Mr. Green, who resided on an island at the mouth
of the Washademoak Lake. He said he was a
Frenchman, on his way to Fredericton about land,
and called for the purpose of enquiring the way.
Mr. Green informed him that he was on an island,
and that he had better stay till the morning, and
that he would then direct him on his journey. He
made on a large fire, by which the man examined
his pocket-book, and was observed to cast several
papers into the fire, and finally he threw in the
pocket-book also. Mr. Green on seeing this, had an
immediate impression that the man must be some
improper character, which idea was strengthened
by the circumstance of its being a time of war. In
the morning, therefore, he took him in his canoe,
and carried him directly to Justice Colwell, a
neighboring magistrate, that he might give an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>account of himself. On his examination, he answered
with so much apparent simplicity, that the Justice
could find no just ground for detaining him, and
consequently dismissed him. He then made his
way to an Indian camp, and hired an Indian, as he
said, to carry him to Fredericton; and crossing the
river, went to Vail’s tavern, on Grimross neck,
where he ordered breakfast for himself and his
Indian, and had his boots cleaned. At this moment,
Mr. Bailes, whom he had robbed the day preceding,
was getting breakfast at Mr. Vail’s, and writing
advertisements in quest of the robber. About eleven
o’clock, he, with the Indian started again, leaving
Mr. Vail’s unknown and undetected; but not without
taking with him a set of silver teaspoons from a
side closet in the parlour.</p>

<p class='c009'>The time was now come for the sitting of the Court,
and about eleven o’clock on Tuesday morning,
the Attorney General arrived from Fredericton,
with very unfavourable impressions on his mind,
bringing information that the robber was still
traversing the country, stealing and robbing wherever
he came, without sufficient effort being made
for his apprehension. The Jury also were collecting
from the different Parishes of the County, bringing
with them unfavourable ideas, from the reports in
circulation concerning his escape. Among the many
opinions that were formed on the subject, one
particularly, was very industriously circulated. The
prisoner was a Freemason, and it will be recollected
that Mr. Dibble, the gaoler, was stated in a former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>part of the narrative to be a Freemason also, and
that there was a Freemason Lodge held at Kingston.
The public mind was strongly prejudiced against
us, unwilling to believe the real circumstances of
his elopement; and the Court assembled under the
strongest impressions that his escape was connived
at. The Honorable Judge Chipman presided on
the occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Court was now ready for business, but no
prisoner; yet high expectations were cherished
that every hour would bring tidings of his
apprehension, as he was pursued in every direction.
The Grand Jury was empannelled, and the Court
adjourned till next day at eleven o’clock, waiting
anxiously for the proceeds of the intermediate time.
And to render the means for his apprehension as
effectual as possible, Mr. Benjamin Furnald, with a
boat well manned, was dispatched in the pursuit
with directions to follow on as far as he could get
any account of him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wednesday, the Court again met and commenced
other business; but nothing from Smith yet. In
the afternoon, Mr. John Pearson, witness against
him, arrived from Nova Scotia, a distance of two
hundred and eighty miles. Towards evening conclusions
were beginning to be drawn that he had
eluded all his pursuers, and was making his way
back to Nova Scotia, and the conjecture almost
amounted to a certainty by the circumstance of a
man being seen crossing the Washademoak and
making towards Bellisle Bay.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Nothing more was heard till Thursday morning
early, when Mr. B. Furnald returned, and reported
that he had found his course and pursued him
through Maugerville; that the night before he
(Mr. F.) reached Maugerville, the robber had lodged
at Mr. Solomon Perley’s, and stole a pair of new
boots, and had offered the silver teaspoons for sale
that he had stolen at Mr. Vail’s. That he walked
up as far as Mr. Bailey’s tavern, where he stopped
some time, and that he was afterwards seen towards
evening under a bridge, counting his money. This
was the last that could be heard of him in this
place; it was now believed that he had taken an
Indian to pilot him, and had gone by way of the
Washademoak and head of Bellisle for Nova Scotia.
This was in accordance with the idea entertained
at Kingston before Mr. Furnald’s return.</p>

<p class='c009'>At ten o’clock on Thursday morning, the Court
met according to adjournment, to bring the business
then before them to a close, without much hope of
hearing any further of the horse-stealer at this
time; when about three in the afternoon, a servant
of Mr. Knox’s, (who it will be remembered was
the plaintiff in the cause,) came direct to the Court
with information to his master, that his other horse
was missing out of the pasture; that he had been
known to be in the pasture at one o’clock at night,
and was gone in the morning; and that a strange
Indian had been seen about the place. This
extraordinary news produced much excitement in
the Court; and the coincidence of the Indian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>crossing the country with the robber, with the
Indian seen at Mr. Knox’s, confirmed the opinion
that Smith had made himself owner of Mr. Knox’s
other horse also!!! Mr. Knox, on hearing this
news, became exceedingly agitated, had no doubt
but that Smith was the thief again, would not listen
to the sheriff, who was not just willing to credit the
report of the horse being stolen, and affirmed that
his life was in danger if Smith was suffered to run
at large. His Honor, the Judge, expressed his
opinion that great remissness of duty appeared.</p>

<p class='c009'>A general warrant was issued by the Court,
directed to all the sheriffs and Ministers of Justice
throughout the Province, commanding them to
apprehend the said More Smith and bring him to
justice. In the meantime, men were appointed to
commence a fresh march in quest of him, to go
in different directions. Mr. Knox, with Henry
Lyon and Isaiah Smith, took the road to Nova
Scotia; and Moses Foster, the deputy sheriff, and
Nathan Deforest, directed their course to Fredericton,
by the head of Bellisle Bay, with orders to
continue their search as far as they could get
information of him, or to the American settlement.
The sheriff then wrote advertisements for the public
papers, offering a reward of forty dollars for his
apprehension; and the Attorney General increased
the sum to eighty dollars. Indictments were
prepared, and the Grand Jury found a bill against
the sheriff and gaoler, for negligence in suffering
the prisoner to escape. They were held to bail to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>appear at the next Court of Oyer and Terminer to
traverse the indictments. The business of the
Court being at the close, the sheriff paid the
witness, Mr. Pearson, from Nova Scotia, for his
travel and attendance, amounting to one hundred
dollars, after which the Court finally adjourned.</p>

Nothing was heard of our adventurer till
after the return of Mr. Knox with his party
from a fruitless search of ten days in the
Province of Nova Scotia, and as far as Richibucto.
The day following, Mr. Foster and Mr. Deforest
returned from their chase, and reported that after
they had proceeded to within three miles of
Fredericton they heard of a stranger answering to
his description, having lodged all night at a private
house; but had gone on the road towards Woodstock.
They continued the pursuit and found that
he had stopped at Mr. Ingraham’s tavern the night
following, slept late in the morning, being fatigued,
paid his bill and went off; but not without giving
another proof of his characteristic villainy. He
broke open a trunk, which was in the room
adjoining the one he had slept in, and carried off a
full suit of clothes belonging to Mr. Ingraham, that
cost him forty dollars, and a silk cloak, with other
articles, which he concealed so as not to be
discovered. This information gave his pursuers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>sufficient proof that he was indeed the noted
horse-stealer. But Mr. Ingraham, not having
missed his clothes immediately, the robber travelled
on unmolested, and the next day went only as far
as Mr. Robertson’s, where he found a collection of
young people, played the fiddle for them, and
remained the next day and night.</p>

<p class='c009'>He then proceeded towards Woodstock, leaving
the spoons with Mrs. Robertson in exchange for a
shirt, and taking passage in a canoe happened to
fall in company with another canoe that had been
at Fredericton, in which the Rev. Mr. Dibble,
missionary at Woodstock, was passenger, with a
young man poling the canoe. The young man
had seen Mr. Bailes’ advertisement at Fredericton,
describing the man and watch, which had a
singular steel chain; and observed to Mr. Dibble,
that they both answered to the appearance of the
stranger. Mr. D. remarked to the young man that
he might be mistaken, and asked the stranger to
let him see the watch. The stranger handed the
watch with all willingness, and it was found so
exactly to answer to the marks of Mr. Bailes’ watch
that Mr. D. challenged it as the property of Mr.
Bailes. Smith very gravely replied, that it was a
favorite watch that he had owned for a long time;
but that if he had heard of one like it having been
stolen, he had no objection to leave it with him
until he returned, which would be in about two
weeks. Mr. D. replied that the suspicion was so
strong, that he thought he would detain him also,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>until he could hear from Fredericton. Smith
rejoined that he was on important business and
could not be detained; but if he would pay his
expenses and make himself responsible for the
damage incurred by his detention, he would have
no objection to stop till he could send to Fredericton.
Otherwise, he would leave the watch, as he
proposed before, and would return in ten or twelve
days, during which time Mr. D. might satisfy
himself as to the watch. He appeared so perfectly
at ease, without discovering the slightest indications
of guilt, that on these conditions they suffered
him to pass on. He continued his march until
he came to the road that leads to the American
settlement, and as it drew towards evening he
enquired of a resident by the way concerning the
road to the American side; but was asked by the
man to tarry till morning, as it was then near night
and the settlement yet twelve miles distant. He did
not choose to comply with the invitation, and
advanced, as an apology, that two men had gone on
before him, and he feared they would leave him in
the morning if he did not proceed. It happened in
a very short time after, that two young men arrived
there from the settlement, and being asked whether
they had met two men on the road, they answered
in the negative. It was then concluded that Smith
was a deserter, and they turned about and followed
him to the American settlement, but found nothing
of him. The day following, Mr. Foster and Mr.
DeForest arrived at Woodstock, and finding themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>still on the track of him, they pursued on to
the American line, but could hear nothing
concerning him. They then informed the inhabitants
of Smith’s character; and proposed a reward
of twenty pounds for his apprehension. The people
seemed well disposed and promised to do their
utmost.</p>

<p class='c009'>Messrs. F. &amp; D. then made their way back to the
river St. John, and there, most unexpectedly, came
across the path of our adventurer again. They
found that he had crossed the river, stopped at
several houses for refreshments, and called himself
Bond. That he had assumed the character of a
pursuant in quest of the thief who had broken out
of Kingston jail; said that he was a notorious villain,
and would certainly be hung if taken, and appeared
to be extremely anxious that he should be
apprehended. They traced him down to the
river where the Indians were encamped, and found
that he had agreed with an Indian to conduct
him through the woods to the United States,
by the way of Eel River, a route not unfrequently
travelled; and hence had baffled all the efforts of
his pursuers, and finally escaped. Messrs. F. &amp; D.
thought it was now time to return and make their
report. It afterwards appeared that the Indian, his
conductor, after having gone about two days on the
route, began to be weary of his job, (perhaps finding
that it might not be productive of much profit,) and
discovered that Smith carried a pistol, which he did
not like very much, refused to guide him any longer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>gave him back part of his money and returned.
This materially turned the scale with our adventurer
and fortune, that had hitherto smiled on his enterprise,
refused, like the Indian, to conduct him much
further. Unable to pursue his journey alone, he
was, of course, obliged to return, and he had now no
alternative but to try his chance by the known road.
It was now the tenth of October, and he re-appeared
on the old ground, wanting refreshment and in quest
as he said, of a deserter. While his breakfast was
preparing, information of his presence was circulated
among the inhabitants, and Dr. Rice, who was
a principal character in the place, effected his
apprehension, and had him secured.</p>

<p class='c009'>The clothes he had stolen from Mr. Ingraham he
had on, excepting the pantaloons, which he had
exchanged for a pistol. He said he had purchased
the clothes very cheap from a man who he believed
was a Yankee. He was then taken in charge by
Mr. A. Putnam, and Mr. Watson, who set out with
their prisoner for Fredericton. On their way they
stopped at the Attorney General’s, three miles from
Fredericton, and then proceeded into town, where
the Supreme Court was then sitting. The prisoner
was brought before the Court in the presence of
a large number of spectators. The Honorable Judge
Saunders asked him his name, and he unhesitatingly
answered, “Smith.” “Are you the man that
escaped from the gaol at Kingston?” “Yes.”
On being asked how he effected his escape, he said
the gaoler opened the door and the priest prayed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>him out. He was then ordered to prison for the
night, and the next day he was remanded to Kingston
gaol. Putnam and Watson set out with him in
an Indian canoe, one at each end, and the prisoner
handcuffed and pinioned, and tied to the bar of the
canoe, in the centre. They were obliged to watch
him the first night at the place where they lodged,
and the next day they reached the house of Mr.
Bailes, opposite Spoon Island, where he had stolen
the watch and the money, etc. It was near night,
and the passage to Kingston rather difficult; and
they being strangers, Mr. B. proposed that if they
would stop with him till morning, he would conduct
them to Kingston himself. They willingly complied
and having been up the preceding night, Mr. B.
proposed that if they would retire and take some
rest, he with his family would keep watch of the
prisoner. After they had retired, the prisoner
enquired the way to Saint John, and whether there
were any ferries on this side the river. He then
asked for a blanket and leave to lie down. Mrs. B.
made him a bed on the floor; but before he would
lie down, he said he had occasion to go to the door.
Mr. B. awakened Mr. Watson, who got up to attend
him to the door. Smith said to him that if had any
apprehensions, he had better tie a rope to his arm,
which he accordingly did, fastening it above the
handcuffs, with the other end wound round his own
hand. In this situation they went out of doors; but
in an unguarded moment, Smith watching his
opportunity, knocked him down with his handcuffs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>leaving the rope in the hands of his keeper, having
slipped the other end over his hand without untying
the knot.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus, handcuffed and pinioned, and bound with
a rope, the ingenious horse-stealer, by another effort
of his unfailing ingenuity, akin to his mock-sickness,
in the gaol, had effected a second escape from his
keepers, leaving it as a matter of choice, whether to
institute a hopeless search for him in darkness of
the night, or sit down in sullen consultation on what
plan they had best pursue in the morning. Nothing
could exceed the chagrin of Putnam and Watson on
finding themselves robbed of their prisoner, except
the confusion which filled myself and the gaoler on
the knowledge of his unexampled and noted escape
from the gaol. To pursue him in the night, which
was unusually dark, and rainy besides, was both
hopeless and vain; it was therefore thought best to
inform the sheriff in the morning of what had taken
place, and receive his advice as to future proceedings.
In the morning, accordingly, Mr. Putnam proceeded
to Kingston, and on communicating the news to the
sheriff, received a supply of money, with orders to
pursue the road to St. John, while the sheriff, with
two men, proceeded to Mr. Bailes’. There they
received information that Smith had changed his
course, and crossing the Oaknabock Lake in the
night, was directing his course towards Fredericton
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be remembered that previous to his escape,
while a prisoner at Mr. Bailes’, he made particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>enquiries whether there were any ferries on the way
to Saint John, on this side the river. At this time
it would seem that he had looked upon his scheme
as successful, and evidently directed those enquiries
concerning the road with a view to mislead, while
it was his policy to return upon the course which
would be judged the most unlikely of all he should
take. But to return to our story. He came to the
lake the same evening he had got clear of Mr. Watson
and the rope, and there urged as a reason of his
haste in crossing the lake in the night, that he was
on his way to Fredericton to purchase land, and
that he had arranged it with Putnam and Watson,
who had gone to Kingston with the thief, to take
him up in their canoe on their return, and was to
meet them at the intervale above, early the next
morning. This well varnished and characteristic
story procured him a speedy passage over the lake,
and now our adventurer is in undisputed possession
of the country, at liberty to choose which way he
should turn his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>On being put in possession of these particulars,
we immediately and naturally supposed that he was
wisely and prudently directing his course to the
United States, by the way of the Oromocto; and so
we followed up his retreat accordingly; but in that
direction no intelligence could be obtained, and we
remained in total ignorance of his proceedings and
history up to the 26th of October. At this date, when
it was supposed that he had transported himself into
the United States, to our astonishment and surprise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>we find him again in the prosecution of his usual
business in the immediate vicinity of Fredericton.
His first appearance there again, was in a bye-place,
at a small house not then occupied as a dwelling.
It was drawing towards night, and the day having
been rainy, he came to the house wet and cold. An
old man by the name of Wicks, with his son, was
engaged in repairing the house, in which they had
some potatoes. There was also a quantity of dry
wood in the house, but as the old man was about
quitting work for the day, he had suffered the fire
to burn down. The stranger was anxious to lodge
in their humble habitation for the night, but the old
man observed to him, that they did not lodge there
at night, and gave him an invitation to the next
house, where he could accommodate him better.
He did not accept the invitation, but said that he
must go on eight or ten miles that night, and so he
departed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old man and his son secured the door and
retired to their lodgings; but when the morning
came it was found that Smith had returned to the
old house, spent the night, burned up all the wood,
regaled himself on roasted potatoes, and again took
his departure. The following night he paid a
sweeping visit at the house of Mr. Wilmot seven
miles from Fredericton. Finding a large quantity
of linens, sprinkled and ready for ironing, he made
a full seizure of the whole, together with a new coat
belonging to a young man belonging to the house.
The plunderer, finding his booty rather burthensome,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>took a saddle and bridle, which he happened
to discover, put them on a small black pony, which
was feeding in the pasture, and thus rode with
his luggage till he came within two miles of
Fredericton. There he found a barrack or hovel,
filled with hay, belonging to Jack Patterson, a
mullato, which presented a convenient retreat where
he could feed his horse and conceal his plunder.
Here he remained some days undisturbed; would
turn his horse out to feed on the common in the day,
concealing himself in the hay, and would catch him
at night, ride into town, make what plunder he
could, return to his retreat, and conceal it in the
hay.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our adventurer thought it was now high time to
pay his respects to the Attorney General himself,
who lived about three miles distant. Here he was
not altogether unacquainted, having made a previous
call on his passage as a prisoner from Woodstock
to Fredericton. He arrived on the spot about nine
o’clock in the evening, retaining, no doubt, an
accurate remembrance of the entrance to the house;
and everything proved propitious to the object of
his visit; for it happened that there was much
company at the Attorney General’s on the same
evening, whose overcoats, cloaks, tippets, comforters,
&amp;c., &amp;c., were all suspended in the hall. He did
not obtrude himself upon the notice of the
company, but paid his respects to their loose
garments, making one sweep of the whole consisting
of five top coats, three plaid cloaks, a number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>tippets, comforters and other wearing articles!
Having been more successful than perhaps he
expected, he rode back through the town to the place
of concealment, deposited his booty, and gave his
horse, after his travel, a generous allowance of hay.
This generosity to his horse led to his detection, for
Patterson happening to perceive that his hay was
lying in an unusual manner out of the window of
his barrack immediately formed an opinion that
some person had taken up lodgings in the hay, and
in this he was not mistaken; for on coming to the
spot, he found Smith lying in the hay, with a white
comforter about his neck. On perceiving him to
be a stranger, he asked him where did he come
from, and was answered that he came from the
Kennebeccasis, was after land, and getting belated
had taken up his lodging in the hay, and hoped it
was no harm.</p>

<p class='c009'>After Patterson had gone into his house he
perceived that the traveller had retired from the
barrack by the window and was making towards
the woods. Upon perceiving this, the idea of his
being a deserter instantly presented himself to his
mind and calling for assistance, he soon made the
stranger a prisoner, which was easily affected, as
he did not make much effort to escape. It was
soon discovered that their prisoner was no less a
person than the far-famed Henry More Smith, and no
time was lost in committing him to Fredericton gaol.</p>

<p class='c009'>Patterson, not seeing the comforter with him
which he wore around his neck, in the hay, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>induced to examine the hay if perhaps he might
find it. This led to the discovery of his entire
deposit; for, he not only found the immediate
object of his search, but also all the articles
previously mentioned, with many more, which were
all restored to the owners respectively.</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon the examination of the prisoner, he gave
no proper satisfaction concerning the articles
found in the hay; he said they were brought there
by a soldier, who rode a little pony, and went off,
leaving the saddle and bridle. He was then
ordered to be taken by the sheriff of York County
and safely delivered to the sheriff of King’s
County in his prison. Accordingly, the sheriff
prepared for his safe conveyance an iron collar,
made of a flat bar of iron, an inch and a half wide,
with a hinge and clasp, fastened with a padlock.
To the collar, which was put around his neck, was
fastened an iron chain, ten feet in length; thus
prepared, and his hands bound together with a
pair of strong handcuffs, after examining his
person lest he should have saws or other instruments
concealed about him, he was put on board
a sloop for his old residence in Kingston. They
started with a fair wind, and with Patterson, the
mulatto, holding the chain by the end, they arrived
with their prisoner at Kingston, a distance of sixty
miles, about 12 o’clock on the night of the 30th of
October, which was better than one month from
the time of his triumphant escape through means
of his pretended indisposition. On his reappearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>in the old spot and among those who had ministered
so feelingly to his comfort during the whole period
of his affected illness, and whom he had so
effectually hoaxed, it might have been expected
that he would have betrayed some feeling or
emotion; or that a transient blush of shame, at
least would have passed over his countenance; but
ah! no; his countenance had long since become
seared, and there was no sensibility within, strong
enough to give the slightest tint to his shame proof
countenance. He appeared perfectly composed,
and as indifferent and insensible to all around him
as though he were a statue of marble.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the ensuing morning he was conducted to
the gaol, which he entered without hesitation or
seeming regret. After his former escape, it had
been cleared out of everything, and carefully swept
and searched. In the course of the search there
were found several broken parts of a watch, and
among the rest, the box which contained the main
spring, this convinced us that the watch, (which he
received from the young man before his escape, in
exchange for the spy-glass,) was intended to furnish
him the materials for making a saw in case all
other plans he might adopt to accomplish his release
should fail to succeed. We found a large dinner
knife cut in two, which we supposed to have been
done with a saw made of the mainspring, as a trial
or experiment of its utility.</p>

<div class='c008'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/ch5-caph.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Having by this time, from painful experience
become a little acquainted with the depth
of his genius, we thought it not impossible
nor unlikely, that he might still have the saw
concealed about his person, although Mr. Berton,
the sheriff of York County, had searched him before
his removal from Fredericton gaol. We were,
however, determined to examine him more closely,
for which end we took off his handcuffs, and then
ordered him to take off his clothes. Without
hesitation or reluctance he divested himself of his
clothes, all to his shirt; we then searched every
part of his dress—the sleeves, wristbands, collar
of his shirt, and even to the hair of his head; but
found nothing. We then suffered him to put on
his clothes again, and we carried out of the gaol
his hat and shoes, and every article he brought
with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The prison in which he was confined was twenty-two
feet by sixteen; stone and lime walls three
feet thick on the sides, the fourth side having been
the partition wall between the prison rooms. This
partition was of timber, twelve inches thick, lathed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>and plastered. The door was of two inch plank,
doubled and lined with sheet iron, with three iron
bar hinges, three inches wide, clasped over staples
in the opposite posts, and secured with three strong
padlocks; and having also a small iron wicket door
secured with a padlock. There was one window
through the stone wall, grates within and without,
and enclosed with glass on the outside, so that no
communication could be had with the interior
undiscovered. The passage that leads to the prison
door is twenty feet in length and three feet in
breadth, secured at the entrance by a padlock on
the door; the outside door was also kept locked, so
that no communication could be had through the
passage, without passing through three securely
locked doors, the keys of which were always kept
by Mr. Dibble, the gaoler, who from his infirm
state of health, never left the house day or night.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having learned a lesson by former experience, we
maintained the most unbending strictness, suffering
no intercourse with the prisoner whatever. In this
manner secured, we put on his right leg an iron
chain no more than long enough to allow him to
reach the necessary, and take his provision at the
wicket door. The end of the chain was fastened to
the timber of the floor by a strong staple, near the
partition wall, so that he could not reach the grated
window by five or six feet. He was provided with
a bunk, straw and blankets, as a bed; and his
wrists having been much swelled with the handcuffs,
I considered it unnecessary to keep them on,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>especially as he was so thoroughly secured in other
respects. In this situation I left him, with directions
to the jailor to look to him frequently through
the wicket door, to see that he remained secure,
intending at the same time to visit him occasionally
myself.</p>

<p class='c009'>The jailor came to look at him frequently at the
wicket door, as directed, and always found him
quiet and peaceable, either sitting up reading, or
lying down in his berth; he never uttered any
complaints, but appeared resigned to his confinement.
I visited him once or twice in the week to
see, for myself, that his irons remained secure: and
always finding him as yet, in the same state of
security in which I had left him, I made up my mind
that we should be able to keep him without any
additional trouble. He manifested good nature as
well as resignation, for he always came to the wicket
door when I wished to see that his irons were in
order, with the greatest seeming willingness.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the twelfth day of his confinement, I was
informed that Mr. Newman Perkins had heard an
unusual noise in the night, which induced him to
think that Smith had been at work at the grates.
On making more particular inquiry, I learned from
Mrs. Perkins that she had heard a noise like rubbing
or filing, late in the night; and by holding her head
out of the window, she considered the sound to
proceed from the jail. Knowing the situation of
the prisoner, chained, that he could not reach the
grate by five or six feet; and knowing, also, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>after the search we had made, it was impossible that
he could have retained about his person anything by
which he could operate on the grates, we judged it
more than improbable that the sound could have
proceeded from him. Nevertheless, we did not treat
the information with disregard or neglect. I went
immediately to the prison, accompanied by Moses
Foster, George Raymond, Allen Basten, and Mr.
Dibble, the jailor, with several others. It was then
the evening, and we carried with us two or three
candles. On opening the door, we found him lying
in his berth, chained just as I had left him. I said
to him, “Smith, you have not got out yet;” he
answered, “no, not quite.” I then examined every
bar of the grates as closely as possible, as also did
every one present again and again, until we were all
satisfied that the cause of the alarm was only
imaginary. Smith all the time lying quiet, answering
readily any and every question that was put to
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Basten had yet continued searching and
examining the inner grates, when it was discovered
by all present that there was a small chip lying on
the flat bar of the outer grate, which was supposed
to have been there accidently. Mr. Basten, however,
being fully satisfied that the inner grate remained
secure, was led rather by curiosity, to reach through
his hand, and take up the chip that lay on the bar
of the outer grate; on doing this, he thought he
could perceive that the bar was inclined to hang in
a small degree. This led to further examination;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>and to the utter astonishment of all that were present
it was found that the bar was cut one-third off, and
artfully concealed with the feather edge of the chip.
Our astonishment was increased by the fact that it
was impossible to reach the outer grate without first
removing the inner. This gave the hint for a more
effectual examination, when it was found that he had
cut one of the inner bars so neatly, that he could
remove and replace it at pleasure, having contrived
to conceal the incisions in such a manner as to
almost preclude the possibility of detection. There
is little or no doubt in two or three nights more he
would have effected his second escape, had not his
works been discovered, through the very means
which, artful as he was, he employed to conceal
them. On being asked what instrument he used in
cutting the grate, he answered with perfect
indifference, “with this saw and file;” and without
hesitation handed me from his berth a case-knife,
steel-blade, neatly cut in fine teeth, and a common
hand saw file. I then asked him how he got to the
grates, or whether he had slipped the shackles off
his feet? he answered me, no; but that he had cut
the chain in the joint of the links, a part where the
cut could not very readily be discovered.</p>

<p class='c009'>On being asked where he got his tools, he
answered that he had left them in the gaol when he
went away, and that those he had given me were
all the tools he had left. But perceiving from the
shape of the knife, (it having been much thicker
on the back than the edge,) that the bars could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>never have been cut so neatly through with that
instrument, we were induced to make a stricter
search, and found, in a broken part of the lime
wall, near the grates, a very neat spring saw, having
a cord tied at one end. I then asked him who gave
him those tools; to which he replied with great
firmness:—“You need not ask me again, for I never
will tell you.” After I had finished these enquiries,
I searched his bed and his clothes, and renewed the
chain again to his leg, fastening it firmly to the floor
with a staple; and putting on a pair of strong
handcuffs of 7-8 bolt. We then left him, it being
about 11 o’clock on Saturday night. On the next
Sunday at 4 o’clock, I revisited the jail, when the
gaoler informed me that the prisoner was lying in
his berth with all his irons on, and had been
enquiring of him if the sheriff was not coming to
examine his chains. About 12 o’clock the same
night I was alarmed by a man sent by the gaoler,
to inform me that Smith had got loose from his
irons, and having worked his way through the inner
grate, was cutting the outer grate, and had nearly
escaped.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here, at the dead hour of midnight, when it
might be expected that every eye would be sunk in
the stillness of sleep through the vigilant attention
of Mr. Dibble, the gaoler, this astonishing being,
who set handcuffs, and shackles, and chains at
defiance, had all but effected another escape. Mr.
Dibble, on finding him to be at work at the grates,
was determined, if possible, to take him in the act;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>and by fastening a candle to the end of a stick three
feet in length, and shoving the light through the
wicket gate, he was enabled to discover him at work
before he could have time to retreat to his berth.
Mr. Dibble, on perceiving how he was employed,
ordered him to leave everything he had, and take
to his berth; he instantly obeyed, but as suddenly
returned to the grates again, placed himself in a
position to which he could not be seen by the gaoler.
Remaining here but a moment, he went quickly to
the necessary, and threw something down which
was distinctly heard, and finally retired to his berth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Dibble maintained a close watch until I
arrived at the gaol, which we immediately entered,
and to our amazement found him extricated from
all his irons. He had cut his way through the inner
grate and had all his clothes collected, and with him
ready to elope, and had cut the bar of the outer
grate two thirds off, which no doubt, he would have
completed long before morning, and made his
escape. I said to him, “Smith, you keep at work
yet;” he answered that he had done work now,
that all his tools were down the necessary. The
truth of this, however, we proved by letting down
a candle, by which we could clearly see the bottom;
but no tools were to be seen there. His return to
the necessary, and dropping, or pretending to drop
something down, was no doubt, an artifice, by which
he attempted to divert our attention from the real
spot where his tools were concealed. But in this
also, with all his cunning, he overshot the mark, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>his over eagerness to tell us where he had cast his
tools, instead of allowing us rather to draw the
conclusion ourselves, from his return to the place,
and dropping something down. We next proceeded
to strip off and examine his clothing, carefully
searching every hem and seam. His berth we
knocked all to pieces, examining every joint and
split; we swept out and searched every part of the
prison, knowing that he must have his instruments
in some part of it; but all to no purpose—nothing
could be discovered.</p>

<p class='c009'>We next replaced all his chains with padlocks;
put on him a pair of screw handcuffs, which confined
his hands close together, and thus left him about
4 o’clock on Monday morning. On the day following,
Mr. Jarvis, the blacksmith, having repaired the
grates came to put them in, when he found Smith
lying on the floor apparently as we left him; but,
on examining the new handcuffs, which screwed
his hands close together when put on, we found
them separated in such a manner that he could put
them off and on when he pleased. On being asked
why he destroyed those valuable handcuffs,
“because,” said he, “they are so stiff that nobody
can wear them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>No doubt then remained that he must have his
saws concealed about his body, and having been
ordered to take off his clothes, he complied with his
usual readiness. On taking off his shirt, which
had not been done at any time previous in our
searches about his body, Dr. A. Paddock, who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>present, and employed in the search, discovered a
small muslin cord about his thigh, close to his body,
and drawn so close that it could not be felt by the
hand passing over it with the shirt between. This
small cord was found to conceal on the inside of his
thigh a fine steel saw plate, two inches broad and
ten inches long, the teeth neatly cut on both the
edges, no doubt of his own work. After this
discovery we put on him light handcuffs, secured
his chains with padlocks again, and set four men
to watch him the whole night. The next day we
secured the inner grate, filling the squares with
brick, lime and sand, leaving a space at the upper
corner of only four by five inches, in which was
inserted a pane of glass in the centre of the wall.
This small opening in a wall three feet thick,
admitted little or no light, so that the room was
rendered almost a dungeon, which prevented the
prisoner from being seen at any time from the door
without the light of a candle. From this time we
never entered the prison without candles and two
or three men.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 13th of November, I addressed a letter to
Judge Chipman, to which I received the following
answer:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Saint John, November 14, 1814—Dear Sir,—I
received your letter of yesterday relating to the
new attempts of H. M. Smith to escape. I have
forwarded the same to Fredericton, and presume
that a court will be ordered for his trial as soon as
may be practicable for the state of the travelling,
and the necessity of procuring the witness from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Nova Scotia; though I should suppose not before
the ice makes. In the mean time the utmost vigilance
and precaution must be made use of to secure
him; you will be justified in any measures of severity
that you may find it necessary to adopt for this
purpose.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I am, dear Sir, faithfully yours,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Walter Bates</span>, Esq.        <span class='sc'>Ward Chipman</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Wednesday, the 16th, we entered the prison and
found that he had been employed in breaking the
plaster off the partition wall with his chains, and
broken one of the padlocks, and appeared to have
been loose; seemed very vicious, and said “he would
burn and destroy the building—would make it
smoke before he left it” and that we would see it
smoke. I then prepared a pair of steel fetters, case
hardened, about 10 inches long, which we put on
his legs, with a chain from the middle, 7 feet long,
which we stapled to the floor; we also put an iron
collar about his neck, with a chain about 8 feet long,
stapled also to the floor in a direction opposite to
the other; and also a chain from his fetters to the
neck collar, with handcuffs bolted to the middle of
his chain in such a manner as to prevent his hands
from reaching his head and feet when standing,
leaving it just possible for him to feed himself
when sitting.</p>

<p class='c009'>All these irons and chains he received without
discovering the least concern or regard. When the
blacksmith had finished riveting the whole, I said
to him, “Now, Smith, I would advise you to be
quiet after this, or if you are not you will next have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>an iron band put round your body and stapled fast
down to the floor.” He very calmly replied, “Old
man, if you are not satisfied, you may put it on now.
I do not regard it, if you will let me have my hands
loose you may put on as much iron as you please.
I care not for your iron.” In this situation we left
him, loaded with irons, the entire weight of which
was forty-six pounds, and without anything to sit
or lie upon but the naked floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although he was thus situated and in an entire
dungeon, he appeared not in the least humbled;
but became more troublesome and noisy, and
exceedingly vicious against the gaoler. Despair
and madness seemed now to seize him, and raving
and roaring would unite with the utterance of
prayers and portions of the Scriptures. With a
tremendous voice he would cry out, “Oh you cruel
devils—you murderers—you man-slayers—you
tormentors of man? How I burn to be revenged;
help, help, help me; Lord help me to be revenged
of those devils; help me that I might tear up this
place, that I may turn it upside down, that there
may not be one stick or stone of it left. My hair
shall not be shorn, nor my nails cut, till I grow as
strong as Sampson, then will I be revenged of all
my enemies. Help, help, O Lord help me to destroy
these tormentors, murderers of man, tormenting me
in chains and darkness;” shouting, “darkness,
darkness, O darkness—not light to read the Word
of God,—not one word of comfort from any. All
is,—you rogue, you thief, you villain,—you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>deserve to be hanged. No pity, not one word of
consolation,—all darkness, all trouble;” singing,
“trouble, trouble, trouble; O God help me, and
have mercy upon me; I fear there is no mercy for
me;—yes, there is mercy, it is in Jesus, whose
arms stand open to receive; but how shall I dare to
look at Him whom I have offended.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he would call upon his parents and deprecate
his wicked life; then rave again, “murderers,
tormentors, consider you have souls to save, consider
you have souls to lose as well as I, a poor prisoner;
consider you have children that may be brought to
trouble as well as I; consider I have parents as well
as they. O! if my parents knew my situation, it
would kill them. My wife, begone from my sight;
why will you torment me! It is for you
that I suffer all my sorrow—it is for you
my heart bleeds. Not a friend comes to see me—nothing
before me but pain and sorrow, chains and
darkness, misery and death, O! wretched me, how
long am I to suffer in this place of torment! Am I
to linger a life of pain and sorrow in chains and
misery? No, I will cut the thread of life and be
relieved from this place of darkness and trouble,”
singing “trouble, trouble, trouble,” a thousand
times repeated. In this manner he continued
raving till he became very hoarse and exhausted,
would take no notice of anything that was said to
him, and finally left off speaking entirely.</p>

<p class='c009'>The weather having become very cold, he was
allowed his berth again, with a comfortable bed of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>straw and blankets; but the blankets had to be
taken away from him again, on account of his having
attempted to <i>hang</i> himself with one of them made
into a rope. He next attempted to starve himself,
but this he gave over, after having fasted three or
four days. He now dropped into a state of quietness,
and lay in his bed the most of the time, day
as well as night; but on the 16th of December we
found on examining his prison, that he had broken
the iron collar from his neck, and drawn the staple
from the timber; but replaced it again so as to
prevent detection.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 17th, we put a chain about his neck, and
stapled it to the floor in such a manner that he
could not reach either of the staples. In this
situation he remained secure and rather more quiet,
yet with occasional shouting and screaming until
the 15th of January. The weather having now
become very cold, and no fire allowed him, fears
were entertained that he might freeze; to prevent
which it became necessary to remove his irons, which
with the exception of his fetters and handcuffs, were
accordingly taken off. For this relief Smith showed
no sign of thankfulness, but became more noisy and
troublesome, especially in the night, disturbing all
within the reach of his voice, with screeching and
howling, and all manner of hideous noises, entirely
unlike the human voice, and tremendously loud,
even beyond conception. In this manner he
continued for five months, occasionally committing
violence upon himself and breaking his chains,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>during which period he could never be surprised
into the utterance of one single word or articulate
sound, and took no notice of any person or thing,
or of what was said to him, no more than if he had
been a dumb, senseless animal; yet performing
many curious and astonishing actions as will be
related hereafter.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the New Testament, which he always kept by
him, a leaf was observed to be turned down, under
which, upon examination, was found the following
Scripture, in the 3rd Chapter of 1st Corinthians,
“And I, brethren, could not speak unto you,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>The weather having been intensely cold throughout
the month of January, and he having no fire,
great fears were entertained that he must perish
from cold, but astonishing to relate his hands and
feet were always found to be warm, and even his
chains! In February, when the weather began to
moderate a little, he became more troublesome;
began to tear off the lime wall and lathing, from the
partition and break everything he could reach. A
strong iron-hooped bucket that contained his drink
he broke all to pieces; the hoops he broke up into
pieces not exceeding three inches long, and would
throw the pieces with such dexterity, though
handcuffed, as to put out the candle when the gaoler
would bring the light to the wicket door to examine
what he was doing.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the weather moderated he became more noisy
and vicious, as will appear by the following letter
which I received from the gaoler on February 10th:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,—There must be something done
with Smith—he is determined to let me know
what he is if no one else does—he sleeps in the day
time, and when I go to tell him to keep still at
night, he yells so as not to hear what I say to him.
Instead of thanks for taking off his irons, he makes
all the noises he can by yelling and screaming all
night, and knocking very loud all night with some
part of his irons. I wish you would come up early
and advise what is best to be done.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>W. Dibble.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I came to the gaol accordingly, and found his
irons uninjured, and to prevent him from using his
hands so freely, locked a chain from his fetters to
his handcuffs, and left him.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Sunday, two gentlemen from Nova Scotia, at
the request of Smith’s wife, came to make enquiry
after him. I went with them to the gaol to see if
he would speak or take any notice of them, or of
what they would say to him from his wife. They
told him that his wife wished to know if he would
have her come to see him, and what she would do
with the colt he left; that she would sell it for two
hundred dollars, and have the money sent to him.
But all they said had no effect on him, any more
than if he had been a lifeless statue, which
convinced us that he would go to the gallows without
speaking a word or changing his countenance.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next week he became more restless and
vicious, and on Sunday, on going to the gaol with
Mr. Rulofson, from Hampton, and Mr. Griffith,
from Woodstock, found he had broken up part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>his berth, and broken his chain from the handcuffs,
leaving one link to the staple, the parted links
concealed; tore up part of his bedding and stopped
the funnel of the necessary. It appeared also that
he had been at the grates; but how he got there
was a mystery, for the chain by which his legs
were bound, was unbroken, and the staple fast in
the timber. We then raised the staple and again
put on the chain to his handcuffs, fastening the
staple in another place, more out of his reach.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day I found he had again broken the
chain from his handcuffs and torn a large portion
of lathing and plastering from the middle wall.
Finding this, I determined to confine him more
closely than ever, and so put a chain from his feet
round his neck, stapled to the floor, securing the
handcuffs to the middle of the chain. He had
already given such mysterious and astonishing
proofs of his strength and invention, that I feared
he would finally baffle all my ingenuity to prevent
his escape. The twisting of the iron collar from
his neck and drawing the staple from the timber,
was a feat that filled every one with wonder. The
collar was made of a flat bar of iron, an inch and a
half wide, with the edges rounded. This he
twisted as if it were a piece of leather, and broke it
into two parts, which no man of common strength
could have done with one end of the bar fastened
in a smith’s vise. The broken collar was kept a
long time and shown to many a wonderer. As
might be expected, his wrists were frequently much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>swelled and very sore from his exertion to break
and get loose from his irons; yet he appeared as
insensible and as regardless of his situation as if he
had in reality been a furious maniac.</p>

<p class='c009'>Notwithstanding the seeming insanity which
characterized these works of his in the prison, yet
other parts of his performance there indicated the
most astonishing genius and invention; perhaps in
a manner and degree unequalled in the memory of
man. On the 1st of March, on entering his prison
in the evening, we found him walking in front of
an <i>effigy or likeness of his wife</i>, which he had made
and placed before him against the wall as large as
life. When the light was thrown upon this scene,
which he had prepared and got up in the dark, it
not only filled us with amazement, but drew out all
the sensibilities of the heart with the magic of a
tragedy, not so much imaginary as real. This effigy
he intended to represent his wife, visiting his
wretched abode, and manifesting signs of disconsolation,
anguish and despair, on beholding her
wretched husband moving before her in chains and
fetters, with dejected mien, and misery and despair
depicted in his countenance. The effigy was formed
out of his bedding and the clothes and shirt he tore
off his body, together with a trough three or four
feet in length, which was used in the jail to contain
water for his drink. Rough as the materials were,
yet he displayed such ingenuity in its formation,
and conducted the scene in a manner so affecting,
that the effect it produced when viewed with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>light of the candles, was really astonishing, and had
a kind of magical power in drawing out the
sympathies of every one who witnessed it.</p>

<p class='c009'>He continued noisy and troublesome till the 5th
of March, when we took his irons off, and caused him
to wash himself and comb his hair, which had not
been cut since he was put in jail; neither had his
beard been shaved. On receiving a piece of soap for
washing, he ate a part, and used the rest. We then
gave him a clean shirt, which he put on himself
with the rest of his clothing, after which we
replaced his irons, which he received in the same
manner as an ox would his yoke, or a horse his
harness.</p>

The term of the Court of Common Pleas was
now coming on, which required much of
my attention for the necessary preparations;
and Mr. Dibble, the jailer, being about to remove
to Sussex Vale, to take charge of the Academy
there, my situation began to look rather awkward
and unpleasant. Accordingly the jailer moved
away on the 11th of March, after the sitting of the
Court, and from the extraordinary trouble which
the prisoner was known to have given, I had little
hope of finding any one who would be willing to
take the charge. However I prevailed with Mr.
James Reid (a man in whom I could confide) to
undertake the charge of him; who, with his family
moved into the house the day following.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this, Smith appeared more cheerful, and
became rather more quiet, until the 24th of March,
when I was called on by the jailer, who informed
me that Smith was attempting to break through the
partition where the stove-pipe passed through into
the debtors’ room. On entering the jail we found
him loose from all his irons,—his neck-chain was
broken into three pieces; the chain from his neck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>to his feet into three pieces; the screw handcuffs
into four pieces, and all hanging on nails on the
partition. His great coat was torn into two parts,
through the back, and then rent into small strips,
one of which he used as a belt, and supported with
it a wooden sword which he had formed out of a
lath, and with which he amused himself by going
through the “sword exercise,” which he appeared
to understand very well. The chains from his legs
were disengaged from the staples, and tied together
with a strip of the torn coat. His hand, his feet
and his clothes, were all bloody; and his whole
appearance presented that of an infuriated madman.
There were present on this occasion Messrs.
Daniel Micheau, Moses Foster, George Raymond,
Walker Tisdale, the jailer and some others. I
then raised the staple, secured him by the leg chain
put on a pair of stiff handcuffs, and added a chain
to his neck, stapled to the floor. In this situation
we left him until the 28th, when I was again called
by the jailer, who said he believed he was loose
again, and about some mischief.</p>

<p class='c009'>On entering the jail, I accordingly found him
loose,—the chain from his neck in three parts; he had
beaten the lime off the wall with a piece of his
chain three feet long. We left him for the purpose
of getting his chains repaired; at night we added a
new chain from his fetters to his neck, and stapled
him to the floor with a chain about four feet long;
we secured his handcuffs to the chain between his
neck and feet, so that when standing, he could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>reach in any direction. In this situation he
remained until the 31st, spending the time in singing
and hallooing occasionally. I was then again
called by the jailer, who, on opening the wicket door,
found a piece of chain hanging on the inside.
I went immediately to the jail and found that he
had separated all his chains, had tied his feet chain to
to the staple again, and was lying in his bed as unconcerned
as if nothing had happened, having a piece
of chain about his neck. We then took his bunk
bedstead from him, and removed everything out of
his reach; no link in his chains appeared to be
twisted, nor were there any broken links to be seen;
from this we inferred that he still must have some
means of cutting his chains.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment, however, it occurred to us that
he might have the broken links concealed in the
privy. We accordingly let down a candle, by
which we could see the bottom, and with an iron
hook prepared for this purpose, we brought up a
bunch of broken links which he had tied up in a
piece of his shirt, together with a piece of his neck-chain a foot long. This convinced us that he had
not destroyed his chains by means of cutting them,
but by the application of some unknown mysterious
power. I then determined to break the enchantment,
if strength of chain would do it, and added
to his fetters a large timber chain, which had been
used as the bunk-chain of a bob-sled, by which four
or five logs were usually hauled to a mill at once.
The chains we had previously used were of a size
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>between that of a common ox-chain and a large
horse trace-chain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Secured in this manner we left him, and on the
6th of April found his neck-chain parted again. I
then replaced it with a strong ox-chain about seven
feet long, firmly stapled to the timber. The next
morning the gaoler informed me that from the
uncommon noise he made in the night, he was
convinced he must be loose from some of his irons
or chains. I then concluded that he must have
broken his steel fetters, as I judged it impossible
for human strength or invention, in his situation,
to break either of the ox-chains; but to my utter
astonishment I found the ox-chain parted and tied
with a string to the staple, his handcuffs, fetters,
and log chain having remained uninjured. We
fastened the ox-chain to his neck again, by driving
the staple into another link. After this, he remained
more quiet, his wrists having been much galled and
swelled by his irons, and bruised and rendered sore
by his exertions to free himself from them.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this time I received a letter from the Clerk of
the Circuit, of which the following is a copy:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>St. John</span>, March 15th.—Dear Sir,—At length I
enclose you the precept for summoning a Court of
Oyer and Terminer and Gaol Delivery in your
County, on Thursday, the 20th of April, for the
trial of the horse-stealer—I also enclose a letter from
Major King, for his saddle, stolen from him at the
same time.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>After this our prisoner remained for some time
rather more peaceable, and amused himself with
braiding straw, which he did in a curious manner,
and made a kind of straw basket which he hung on
the partition to contain his bread. Sometimes he
would make the likeness of a man, and sometimes
that of a woman, and place them in postures
singularly striking; discovering much curious
ingenuity. At this he would amuse himself in the
day, but spent the night in shouting and hallooing,
and beating the floor with his chains.</p>

<p class='c009'>On entering the gaol, we discovered the image or
likeness of a woman, intended to represent his
wife. He had it placed in a sitting posture, at the
head of his bed, with the New Testament open
before her, as though reading to him, while he sat
in the attitude of hearing with serious attention. I
was induced to look into the New Testament, and
found it open at the 12th chapter of St. Luke, and
the leaf turned down at the 58th verse, which read
as follows: “When thou goest with thine adversary
to the Magistrate, as thou art in the way, give
diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him;
lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver
thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into
prison.” It would seem as though he had intended
to represent her as reproaching him for his escape
from the constables on his way to Kingston, while
he would defend his conduct by referring to the
above portion of the Scripture. He produced many
other likenesses, which he would place in different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>significant postures manifesting the most remarkable
ingenuity and invention.</p>

<p class='c009'>A special Court for his trial had been summoned
to meet at Kingston on the 20th of April; but it
was postponed until the 4th of May, on account of
the ice having remained unusually late in the river,
as will appear by the following letter:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>St. John</span>, 5th April, 1815—Dear Sir,—I have
received your letter detailing the very extraordinary
conduct of the culprit in your custody. There is
certainly a mystery in this man’s means and
character, which is unfathomable, and I fear there
will be considerable difficulty with him on the trial.
Your vigilance and exertions of course cannot be
relaxed. As the best thing to be done, I dispatched
your letter, without delay, to the Attorney General,
that they might adopt, at Head Quarters, any such
measures as they might think expedient for the
further safeguard and security of the prisoner.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c014'>
    <div>Very respectfully yours,</div>
    <div>To <span class='sc'>W. Bates</span>, Esq.        <span class='sc'>W. Chipman</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sunday</span>, 16th April, 1815—Dear Sir—I have
just received by express from Fredericton, a letter
from the Attorney General, stating that from the
state of the river, it will be impracticable for him
to be at Kingston by the 20th, and as he has
hitherto taken the whole burthen of the trial upon
himself, it cannot go on without him. From the
circumstances, therefore, and as the present state
of the travelling would probably render it dangerous
to my father’s health (who is not now very well) to
hold the court this week, he has determined to put
it off till Thursday, the 4th of May, for which day
he wishes you to summon your jury, and to proclaim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>the holding of the Court. He regrets much giving
you this additional trouble, but it must be attributed
to the extraordinary backwardness of the season,
which was not, probably, foreseen when it was
recommended to hold the Court on the 20th of April.
I have not time to forward a new precept by this
conveyance, but I will forward one in time, or the
one you have may be altered. This can be easily
arranged when we go up to the Court.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c014'>
    <div>Yours truly,</div>
    <div><span class='sc'>W. Bates</span>, Esquire.        <span class='sc'>W. Chipman</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Court was accordingly proclaimed, and at the
same time I wrote a letter, inclosing the proclamation
to Mr. Dibble, the former gaoler, to which I received
the following answer:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>—I yesterday received your letter,
inclosing your proclamation of the Circuit Court,
for the trial of Smith, the horse-stealer. I shall be
very sorry if Judge Chipman’s health should be
such as to prevent his attending the trial. Should
the Attorney General attempt to prosecute on
recognizance for the escape, I think his (the Judge’s)
influence at Court would prevent it. I am quite of
your opinion, that it will be the most difficult case
that has yet been before any Court for trial in this
County. As for his behaving much better after I left
the gaol, it was what I expected he would do, to put
Reid off his guard. Those parts of his chains that
were hanging in convenient situations, were powerful
weapons, and had Reid come into the gaol alone,
or weak-handed, he would have felt the weight of
them. It is remarkable that the villain with all his
art and cunning, should manage it so ill; and it
seems altogether providential that from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>beginning (except his sickness) he has either
delayed too long or been too hasty, which has
prevented his escape before, and I hope and trust
will be the same with you. I am sorry for the
trouble you have with him, and confidently hope
and trust he will not evade your vigilance. You
are too well acquainted with his conduct to need
my advice. I must claim from you the particulars
of his conduct at the trial.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c014'>
    <div>I remain yours truly,</div>
    <div><span class='sc'>W. Bates</span>, Esquire.     <span class='sc'>W. Dibble</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>On the 30th of April, I went to the gaol and
found Smith lying quietly with all his irons and
chains uninjured, and told him that on Thursday
next, the 4th of May, he must have his trial before
the Court for his life or death; and that Mr.
Pearson, the Deputy Sheriff who apprehended him
at Pictou, had come to witness against him; but
he paid no attention to what I said. The second
day Mr. Pearson came to see him, and told him
that his (Smith’s) wife had come to see him; but
he took no notice of him, no more than if he could
neither see nor hear, and set at defiance all attempts
to extort one single expression, as though he were
destitute of every sense.</p>

<p class='c009'>The third day we found that he had been at the
stone wall, his face bruised and bloody. I renewed
my attempts to elicit something from him by
telling him that the next day he would be brought
before the Court for his trial; but all was in vain.
He gave me the most decided indications of confirmed
insanity; patted his hands, hallooed, sang
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>without articulating, and continued to sing and
beat the floor with his chains the most of the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>The 4th of May, the day appointed for his trial,
being now come, the Court began to assemble
early in the morning, and numerous spectators
crowded from every part of the county. About 11
o’clock his Honor Judge Saunders, and the Attorney
General arrived from Fredericton. About 1 o’clock
the whole Court moved in procession to the Court
House, which was unusually crowded with spectators.
After the opening of the Court in the usual form,
the prisoner was called to the bar. The gaoler and
four constables brought him and placed him in the
criminal’s box. He made no resistance, nor took
any notice of the Court, and, as usual, acted the
fool or the madman, snapping his fingers and
patting his hands; he hem’d and ha’d, took off his
shoes and socks, tore his shirt. Every eye was
fixed on him with wonder and astonishment.
After the Attorney General had read his indictment,
the Judge asked him how he pleaded to that
indictment, guilty or not guilty. He stood heedless
and silent, without regarding what was said to him.
The Judge then remonstrated with him, and
warned him that if he stood mute out of obstinacy,
his trial would go on, and he would be deprived of
the opportunity of putting himself on his country
for defence; and that sentence would be given
against him; he therefore advised him to plead not
guilty. He still continued mute, and acting the
fool without betraying the slightest emotion. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Judge then directed the Sheriff to empannel a jury
of twelve men, to enquire whether the prisoner at
the bar stood mute wilfully and obstinately, or by
the visitation of God. From the evidence brought
before the jury on this enquiry, it appeared that
he had been in the same state for three months
preceding, during which time he could not be
surprised into the utterance of one word. The
jury consequently returned their verdict that the
prisoner stood mute by the visitation of God.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Judge then directed the Attorney General to
enter the plea of not guilty; and Counsel for the
prisoner was admitted. The Court then adjourned
till ten o’clock the next morning. The next morning,
Friday, the Court assembled accordingly, and the
prisoner was again brought to the bar, and placed
in the criminal’s box as before. He sat down
quietly, maintained his usual silence and inattention.
The most profound silence reigned in the Court,
which was still crowded with spectators, and every
eye was fixed on the prisoner with the most eager
attention. The Judge then arose, and observed
that the prisoner appeared more calm this morning,
and directed the Attorney General to proceed with
the trial.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the jury had been empannelled and had
taken their seats, and the witnesses brought before
the Court, the prisoner was ordered to stand up for
his defence; hold up his hand, and hear the
evidence; but he still maintained the same disregard
and indifference, giving no attention to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>anything that was said to him. The constables
were then directed to hold up his hand, but to this
he offered the most determined resistance, and
fought and struggled so furiously, that they were
unable to manage him. They then procured a cord
and pinioned his arms; but this was of no avail;
he would flounce and clear himself from them all,
as though he had the strength of some furious
animal.</p>

<p class='c009'>They then procured a rope and lashed his arms
back to the railings of the box; but he still continued
his struggling, and reaching the railings
before him would break them like a pipe-stem.
They then procured another rope and bound his
hands together, and secured them to the railing in
the opposite direction. Finding himself overpowered
in his hands, he immediately availed himself of his
feet, with which he kicked most lustily, and soon
demolished all the railing in front of the box, notwithstanding
all the efforts of the constables to
prevent him. Another rope was then procured,
and his feet bound each way from the posts of the
box, so that he was rendered incapable of further
mischief. After securing him in this manner, all
the constables being in readiness for his movements,
while he himself sat as unconcerned as though
nothing had happened, the Attorney General
proceeded to read his indictment, in which the
prisoner stood charged with having feloniously
stolen a certain bay horse, the property of Frederick
Willis Knox, Esquire, of the value of thirty-five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>pounds. Mr. Knox having been sworn, stated the
manner of his pursuit after the prisoner, with all
the circumstances, until he came to Truro, as has
already been detailed. At Truro he engaged Mr.
Pearson, Deputy Sheriff, to pursue on to Pictou,
whither he was informed the prisoner had gone to
sell the horse.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Peters, counsel for the prisoner, on the cross-examination
of Mr. Knox, asked him how he wrote
his Christian name—“Willis” or “Wills.” He
answered, “I am christened and named after my
god-father, Lord North, the Earl of Willsborough,
and I never write my name Willis.” Mr. Peters then
produced authorities to show where one letter
omitted or inserted in a man’s name had quashed an
indictment, and moved that the prisoner be discharged
from this indictment. This move was
overruled by the judge, but was reserved for a
question in the Court above.</p>

<p class='c009'>The witness Pearson having been sworn, deposed
and said, that he pursued after the prisoner the
whole night, and early the next morning was shown
the prisoner, and arrested him on suspicion of having
stolen the horse, and told him that the owner of the
horse would soon be present. He seemed but little
surprised, and only replied that he came honestly
by the horse. The witness further stated that he
then asked the prisoner where the horse was, who
unhesitatingly pointed to the house where he soon
after found him. Witness went on to state that he
took the prisoner before a Justice for examination,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>and thence to the jail at Pictou. That he then went
to the house which the prisoner had pointed out to
him, and there found the horse; that he returned
homewards with the horse about ten miles, and met
Mr. Knox, who immediately knew the horse, and
called his name “Britain.” That they then returned
to Pictou, where the prisoner remained in jail, and
on examination was found to have in his possession
a watch, and about fifteen guineas in money, with a
number of watch seals and other articles, some of
which it appeared he had stolen on his way as he
escaped with the horse. That he was committed
to the charge of a constable and Mr. Knox, to be
conveyed by a warrant from Nova Scotia to the jail
at King’s County, in New Brunswick. That before
he was taken from the jail at Pictou he had cut the
bolt of his handcuffs nearly through, and had artfully
concealed it, which was fortunately discovered,
and new handcuffs provided, otherwise he must
certainly have escaped from his keepers before he
arrived at Kingston.</p>

<p class='c009'>The circumstances against the prisoner were,
that he gave contradictory statements as to the way
in which he came by the horse; at one time asserting
that he bought him from a pedlar; at another
from a Frenchman; again, that he swapped for
him; and at Amherst produced a receipt for money
paid in exchange.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Counsel for the prisoner, in cross-examining,
asked Mr. Knox, did you ever see the prisoner in
possession of the horse! “No; but he acknowledged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>it.” “Did you ever hear him acknowledge
that he was in possession of the horse in any other
way than by saying he came honestly by him?”
“No.” Mr. Pearson was cross-examined in the
same manner, and answered to the same effect.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Peters, in defence of the prisoner produced
authorities to show that by the evidence the
prisoner was not taken in the manner as stated in
the declaration, and that it was sufficient for him to
prove, in a general way, how he came in possession
of the horse, which he was able to do by a receipt
he produced for the money paid in exchange, the
best general evidence that can be given, as such is
the common way in dealing in horses. He acknowledged
that if the prisoner had been taken on the
back of the horse, he would then have been taken
in the manner as stated by the Attorney General,
and consequently bound to prove how he came in
possession; but in the present case, he himself, or
any one present, might have been in this unfortunate
prisoner’s situation; dragged to the prison, to
court and to the gallows, because he could not
produce the person who actually sold him the horse.
The prosecutor had not produced any evidence of
the horse ever having been in the possession of the
prisoner, any other way than by his own confession;
and he trusted that the jury would not hesitate to
find that the prisoner was not taken in the manner
as stated in the declaration, but would pronounce
him, by their verdict, “Not Guilty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Judge, in his charge to the jury, overruled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>the plea, by stating to the jury that his having been
taken in the manner, was proved by the various
accounts he gave of his getting possession of the
horse, thus rendering himself liable to prove how he
came by him, or to stand guilty of having feloniously
taken him, as stated in the indictment. That they
had heard the witnesses and if, from the evidence
and circumstances before them, they would find him
guilty; but if they had any doubts, that leaning to
mercy, they would find him not guilty.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the jury was out, the sheriff invited the
Court and other gentlemen to visit gaol, where they
were shown the irons and chains, and the situation
in which the prisoner had been placed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The jury, after an absence of about two hours,
returned with a verdict of “Guilty.” The judge
then proceeded to pass upon him the awful sentence
of the law, “Death, without the benefit of Clergy;”
but the criminal remained unmoved and unaffected,
and continued shouting and hallooing. The court
asked the counsel for the prisoner whether he had
anything to offer in arrest of judgment, or why the
sentence of death should not be executed upon him.
Mr. Peters then arose and produced authorities to
show that the present law that took away “the
benefit of Clergy” for <i>horse-stealing</i>, was not in
force in this colony, and that it could not be
construed to be in force, and must be a question to
be decided in the higher court, where he hoped to
have the honor of discussing it. The judge admitted
the plea; but gave his opinion against him.</p>

The business being ended, the prisoner was
returned to his cell where he received his
chains with willingness and apparent
satisfaction; and the court adjourned without delay.
The Attorney General, however, gave me to understand
that the prisoner would not be executed
immediately; and requested that I would observe
his behavior, and inform him by letter the particulars
of his conduct. The next morning I visited him,
and observed to him that he was now under sentence
of death, and he would be allowed only one pound
of bread every day, with water, during the short
time he had to live. That as soon as the death
warrant was signed by the president, he would be
executed, and that a short time only was left him
to prepare for the dreadful event. But he paid no
attention; patted his hands, sang and acted the fool
as usual. One of his visitors being much surprised
at his insensibility, observed to him, “Smith, it is
too late for you to deceive any more; your fate is
fixed now, and you had better employ your little
time in making your peace with God, than to act
the fool any longer.” On our next visit to the gaol,
which was soon after, we found his Testament open,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>and a leaf turned down on the following passage—“If
any man among you seemeth to be wise, let him
become a fool, that he may be wise.” From this it
would appear, that he either founded his pretended
insanity on Scripture precept, or affected to do so;
yet it cannot be supposed that he intended us to
know what use he made of this Scripture, as he
must have known that our conclusion would be that
he was “more rogue than fool.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I kept him nine days on bread and water, during
which time he manifested no sign of hunger, more
than when fed with four times his allowance, and
tore off every particle of his clothing, leaving himself
entirely naked. After this time, I allowed him
other provisions, and his subsequent behavior was
briefly stated in a letter to the Attorney General,
and afterwards, published in the “Royal Gazette.”
The following is a true copy of the letter, as it
appeared in that paper, July 11th, 1815:</p>

<p class='c009'>Copy of a letter from the High Sheriff of Kings
County:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Kingston</span>, June 26th, 1815—My Dear Sir—Having
heard nothing from you since the late gaol
delivery at Kings County, I beg leave to state to
you some circumstances of the criminal, Henry
More Smith, since his trial and sentence. After
securing him with strong chains to his neck and
legs, and with handcuffs, he continued beating the
floor, hallooing day and night with little intermission,
making different sounds; sometimes with
jingling his chains, and sometimes without,
apparently in different parts of the gaol, insomuch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>that the gaoler frequently sent for me, supposing
he must be loose from his chains, which I conceived
and frequently observed was impossible, being far
beyond the power of human strength or invention,
in his situation; but on the 24th of May, going into
the gaol early in the morning, (after examining his
chains at 2 o’clock the day before,) I found three
links of his heaviest chains separated, and lying on
the floor, being part of the chain without the staple.
He continued in the same way until the 2nd of June,
when we found the largest chain parted about the
middle and tied with a string, which clearly proves
that irons and chains are no security for him. I then
put on a light chain, with which he has been ever
since. I never discovered him at work at anything,
but he frequently produced effigies or likenesses,
very striking, representing his wife. He now
produced an effigy of a man in perfect shape, with
his features painted, and joints to all his limbs,
and dressed him in clothes that he had made in
good shape and fashion out of clothes he had torn
off himself, (being now naked,) which was admired
for its ingenuity. This he would put sometimes in
one position and sometimes in another, and seemed
to amuse himself with it, without taking the least
notice of anything else; continuing in his old way
hallooing, without any alteration, until the 13th,
when the gaoler informed me that he refused to eat,
and no doubt was sick. I went to see him every
day—found he did not eat—all the bread and
other provisions conveyed to him he gave to his
effigy, strung on a string, and put in his hands.
He lay perfectly still day and night, and took no
notice of anything—would drink tea or milk, which
I gave him twice a day for five days, he then refused
to drink anything for two days, which made seven
days that he ate nothing. In that time he began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>speak—would ask questions, but would hold no
conversation. But the most extraordinary, the most
wonderful and mysterious of all, is that in this time
he has prepared, undiscovered, and at once exhibited
the most striking picture of genius, art, taste, and
invention, that ever was, and I presume ever will
be produced by any human being placed in his
situation, in a dark room, chained and handcuffed,
under sentence of death, without so much as a nail
of any kind to work with but his hands, and naked.
The exhibition is far beyond my power to describe.
To give you some faint idea, permit me to say, that
it consists of ten characters—men, women and
children—all made and painted in the most
expressive manner, with all the limbs and joints
of the human frame—each performing different
parts; their features, shape and form, all express
their different offices and character, their dress is
of different fashions, and suitable to the stations
in which they are. To view them in their stations,
they appear as perfect as though alive, with all the
air and gaiety of actors on the stage. Smith sits in
his bed by the side of the gaol, his exhibition
begins about a foot from the floor, and compasses
the whole space to the ceiling. The uppermost is
a man whom he calls his tamborine player, or sometimes
Dr. Blunt, standing with all the pride and
appearance of a master musician; his left hand
akimbo, his right hand on his tamborine, dressed
in suitable uniform. Next him, below, is a lady
genteely dressed, gracefully sitting in a handsome
swing; at her left stands a man, neatly dressed, in
the character of a servant, holding the side of the
swing with his right, his left hand on his hip, in an
easy posture, waiting the lady’s motion. On her
right hand stands a man genteely dressed, in the
character of a gallant, in a graceful posture for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>dancing. Beneath these three figures, sits a young
man and a young woman (apparently about
fourteen,) in a posture of tilting, at each end of a
board, decently dressed. Directly under these
stands one whom he calls Bonaparte, or sometimes
the father of his family; he stands erect, his
features are prominent, his cheeks red, his teeth
are white and set in order, his gums and lips red,
his nose shaded black, representing the nostrils;
his dress is that of the harlequin. In one hand
he holds an infant, with the other he plays or beats
music; before him stand two children, apparently
three or four years old, holding each other by the
hand, in the act of playing or dancing, which, with
a man dressed in fashion, who appears in the
character of a steward, sometimes in one situation,
and sometimes in another, makes up the show, all
of which you have in one view. Then commences
the performance.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first operation is from the tamborine player,
or master, who gives two or three single strokes on
his tamborine, that may be heard in any part of the
house, without moving his body. He then dances
gracefully a few steps, without touching his
tamborine; the lady is then swung two or three
times by the steward; then the gallant takes a few
steps; then the two below tilt a few times in the
most easy, pleasant manner; then the two children
dance a little, holding each other by the hand;
after this, Smith begins to sing or whistle a tune,
to which they are to dance, at which the tamborine
strikes, and every one dances to the tune, with
motion, ease, and exactness not to be described.
Many have been the observations of spectators;
amongst them, an old German observed that,
“when he was starving the seven days, he was
making a league with the devil and that he helped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>him.” All acknowledged with me, that it exceeds
anything they ever saw or imagined. His whole
conduct from the first has been, and is, one
continued scene of mystery.</p>

<p class='c013'>He has never shown any idea or knowledge of
his trial or present situation; he seems happy; his
irons and chains are no apparent inconvenience;
contented like a dog or monkey broke to his chain;
shows no more idea of anything past, than if he
had no recollection.</p>

<p class='c013'>He, in short, is a mysterious character, possessing
the art of invention beyond common capacity. I
am almost ashamed to forward you so long a letter
on the subject, and so unintelligible; I think, if
I could have done justice in describing the exhibition,
it would have been worthy a place in the
“Royal Gazette,” and better worth the attention of
the public than all the wax-work ever exhibited in
this Province.</p>

<p class='c013'>“P.S.—Wednesday, the 28th.—This morning I
found he added to his works a drummer, placed at
the left of his tamborine player, equal in appearance,
and exceeding in performance; beats the drum
with either hand, or both occasionally, in concert
with the tamborine, keeping time with perfect
exactness; sometimes sitting, at others standing or
dancing. He had also, in the most striking
manner, changed the position of his scene. The
lady above described to be sitting so gracefully in
her swing, with so many attendants and admirers,
is now represented sitting in a dejected posture,
with a young infant in her arms; her gallant has left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>her, and is taking the young girl before described,
about fourteen, by the hand, with an air of great
gallantry, leading her, and dancing to the tune with
perfect exactness, representing more than can be
described. On viewing this an old Scotchman
observed,—‘Some say he is mad, others he is a
fool; but I say he is the sharpest man I ever saw;
his performance exceeds all I have ever met with,
and I do not believe he was ever equalled by man.’
This evening, a gentleman from Boston, having
heard the above description, came to see the
performance, and declared he could say, as the
Queen of Sheba did, that ‘the half had not been
told.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>To this the editor of the “Gazette” adds the
following remarks:</p>

<p class='c013'>“We have given an entire copy of the above
letter, which has excited our astonishment, and
will, probably, that of every other person who has
not seen the exhibition and performance described
in it. Those who are acquainted with the sheriff,
know him to be incapable of stating falsehoods, or
attempting in any way to practice a deception, and
will, of course, give credit to the statement of facts,
wonderful as they may appear to be, which he has
made.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Supreme Court, in July, being about to be
held in Fredericton, and feeling anxious to know
the fate of the prisoner, I attended for this purpose;
and having ascertained from the Attorney General
that his destiny would not be fatal, I returned again
to Kingston, when the gaoler informed me that the
first night I had left Kingston, Smith had drawn the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>staple of the chain that was about his neck, and had
so concealed them both that they could not be
found; and the glass in the brick wall was broken
at the same time; but that the chain could not
have gone through that way, as the outside glass in
the window was whole; that the room and every
other part of the gaol had been thoroughly
searched; but neither the chain nor staple could
be found; neither could it be imagined how
he broke the glass, as it was far beyond
the reach of his chains. On my entering the jail,
Smith said to me, “The devil told my drummer, if
I did not put that chain out of the way, you would
certainly put it about my neck again;” that he
hated it, and had murdered it and put it under the
dirt; but he feared he should have no peace till he
raised it again. I then told him he must raise it
again, and if he behaved himself well I would not
put it about his neck again. The next morning the
chain was seen lying on the jail floor; but where or
by what means he concealed it, could never be found
out. I then took off his handcuffs, and gave him
water to wash himself. I also gave him a clean
shirt and a jacket, and a young man who was
present gave him a black handkerchief, which he
put about his neck and seemed much pleased; and
said if he had a fiddle, or any instrument of music,
he could play for his family to dance; if he had a set
of bagpipes, he could play on them very well, and
that if we gave him wood and leather, he would
make a set. He was offered a fife, which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>handled in a clumsy way; but he said he believed
he could learn to play on it. He paid the boy for
it, and then took the fife, and would play any tune
either right or left handed. I then told him
if he would behave well I would not put his
handcuffs on that day. He replied that he would
then have his family in good order for my ball; but
he observed that when he put one hand to anything
the other would follow as though the handcuffs were
on. We gave him some materials that he wanted,
and then left him; this was the 17th of July. On
the 18th we found him busily employed with his
family, making improvements for the ball. I gave
him pen, ink, and paint, and many articles for clothing,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>All his figures were formed of straw from his
bedding, curiously entwined and interwoven. The
colouring he had used before was his own blood,
and coal which he got from a piece of burnt timber
in the jail; and their first clothing was made from
his own torn clothes. He now began to talk more
coherently and accounted for the broken glass. He
said to me,—“My drummer cried out for more air;”
his family stood so thick about him. “Well,” said
I “tell me how to get more air and I will go to work
at it. He told me to make a strong whisp of straw,
long enough to reach the glass and break it, which
I did, and then after undoing the whisp put the
straw in my bed again.” He continued improving
his family, by dressing and painting them all anew,
and by adding to their number. He said there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>a gentleman and lady coming from France to attend
his ball, and all of them must perform well. With
the money he received from visitors, many of whom
I have known to give him a dollar for one exhibition,
he purchased calico enough for a curtain or
screen. In front of the partition stood all his family
which he continued to improve and increase, until
he said they were all present and were coming to
the ball; and about the 10th August completed his
show for exhibition. The whole consisted of twenty-four
characters, male and female, six of which beat
music in concert with the fiddle, while sixteen
danced to the tune; the other two were pugilists;
Bonaparte with his sword fighting an Irishman
with his shillelah. His musicians were dressed in
their proper uniform; some were drummers, some
were tamborine players, and some were bell-ringers.
In the centre stood his dancing master, with his hat,
boots and gloves on. In an advanced station stood
an old soldier in Scotch uniform, acting as sentinel,
while Smith himself stood before them, his feet
under the curtain, playing a tune on the fiddle, to
which they would all dance or beat in perfect harmony
with the music—the one half on the right to
one part of the tune, and the other half on the left
to the other part, and then all together as regular
and as natural as life. The dancing master with
his right hand and foot with one part, and his left
hand and foot with the other, and then with the
whole together, with the utmost ease, to any tune
that was played. So ingenious, and I may say, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>wonderful was the exhibition, that it is impossible
to do justice to its description; and numbers of
persons from different parts came to indulge their
curiosity by witnessing the performance, and all
expressed their astonishment in terms the most
unqualified. Doctor Prior, a gentleman from
Pennsylvania, was among the number of visitors.
He told me that he had spent most of his time in
foreign parts, travelling for general and literary
information, and had made it a point to examine
all curiosities, both natural and artificial, and that
having heard much of an extraordinary person I had
in prison, he came for the express purpose of seeing
him and his exhibition. Having viewed his person
and every part of his performance, he was pleased
to say that he had travelled through all the continent
of America, and a great part of Europe, but
had never met anything the equal of what he there
saw performed and that he certainly should not fail
to insert a notice of it in the journal of his travels
and observations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another gentleman, Dr. Couglen, from Ireland,
who had been surgeon in His Majesty’s service both
by land and sea, came also to visit our prisoner, and
see his extraordinary exhibition, and after having
viewed it occasionally for several days, while he
remained at Kingston, declared that he had lived
in England, Ireland and Scotland; had been in
France and Holland and through a great part of
Europe; had been at Hamburg and other places
famous for numerous exhibitions of various kinds,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>but had never met with any that in all respects
equalled what he there saw exhibited. The doctor
then belonging to the Garrison at St. Andrews, having
heard, while at Head Quarters, from the
Attorney General, an account of this extraordinary
character, took his tour from Fredericton by
way of Kingston, for the express purpose of
satisfying his curiosity, and seeing for himself.
When on entering the prison, Smith, seeing the
doctor in regimentals, said to him with much good
humor, “I suppose you are come here looking
for deserters; there is my old drummer, I don’t
know but he deserted from some regiment—the
rest are all my family.” He seemed very much
pleased with his new visitor, and readily exhibited
every part of his performance, to the full satisfaction
of the doctor, who expressed his astonishment in
the most unqualified terms, and acknowledged that
it far exceeded his anticipations.</p>

<p class='c008'>August 13th—At evening we found that he had
improved his Scotch sentinel by giving him a carved
wooden head, finished with the natural features of
a bold Highlander. This was the first of his carved
work. He had also much improved his pugilists.
Bonaparte, by some unlucky stroke, had killed the
Irishman, and had taken off his head and hung it
up at his right hand. A brawny old Scotchman
had taken the Irishman’s place, and was giving the
Corsican a hard time of it, knocking him down as
often as he got up.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Next day at noon I called to see him; he had been
fiddling remarkably well, and singing very merrily;
but on my entering I found him busily employed
at carving a head which was to take Bonaparte’s
place, for that bold Scotchman would overpower
him soon. He observed that carving was a trade
in England, and that he did not expect to do so
well at it before he made the trial; and further
remarked that a man did not know what he could
do until he set about it; and that he had never
failed in anything he undertook. He said he had
never seen any such show in England as that he
was now working at; that he had only dreamed of
his family, and had the impression that he must
“go to work” and make them all; that if he did, it
would be better with him, and if he did not, it would
be bad with him; that he had worked ever since, by
night and by day, and had not quite completed
them yet; that there were a shoemaker and a tailor
that had not come yet for want of room; that he
should make room if he did not go away; that he
had been here until he had become perfectly
contented, and “contentment,” he said “was the
brightest jewel in his life;” and that he never
enjoyed himself better than he did at present with
his family.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the evening I went in to see him again; and
as my curiosity to know the origin of so singular a
character was greatly excited, I hoped that the
present would have proved a favorable opportunity
to draw some information from him; but he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>cautiously and studiously avoided answering any
questions relative to his previous life, and affected
not to understand what I said to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes he would talk very freely, and in a
prophetic strain, of his future destiny. He said he
knew he was going away from home, and that he
should find enemies; every one who knew him would
be afraid of him, and look upon him with distrust
and horror. That occasionally he was distressed in
his sleep with all kinds of creatures coming about
him. Great hogs and all kinds of cattle and creeping
things, snakes and adders, frogs and toads, and
every hateful thing. That he would start up from
sleep and walk about the prison; then lie down and
get asleep, and be annoyed with them again. That
he would sit up and talk to his family, and sometimes
take his fiddle and play to amuse himself, and
drive away these dreary hours of night. He said
these snakes and adders he could read very well;
that he knew what they all meant, and could
understand something concerning the others; but
that these frogs and toads coming together he could
not understand; only that he knew he was to leave
this place and go on the water, and that he could
see as clearly as he saw me standing before him,
that he should find enemies, and everybody would
be afraid of him; but he would hurt no one; that
he should find trouble, and have irons on him, but
that they should come off again; that the crickets
came and would get upon his children and would
sing among them; that he liked to hear them; that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>his mother told him he must not hurt them, they
were harmless, and that he must not hurt anybody.</p>

<p class='c009'>His mother, he continued to say, always gave him
good advice; but he had done that which he ought
not to have done, and had suffered for it; but he
forgave all his enemies. The Lord says, if you
would ask forgiveness of Him, forgive thy brother
also. We cannot expect forgiveness except we
repent and forgive our enemies. The word of God
is plain; except you forgive your brother his
trespasses, neither will your Heavenly Father forgive
you when you ask of him. All men are sinners
before God; watch, therefore, and pray that ye enter
not into temptation. I watch here and pray with
my family night and day; they cannot pray for
themselves. But I shall not stay long; he could go
to sea as supercargo of some vessel, or he could get
his living with his family as a show in any country
but England, and he had never seen such a show
in England; that he had never enjoyed himself
better than with his family at present. He did not
care for himself so long as his family looked well; he
would be willing to die, and he should like to die here
rather than go among his enemies; but he believed
he had one friend in England, old Willie, if he is
yet alive; he was always his friend, and he should
like to go and see him. And he had one sister, he
said, in England, that he wanted to see; she played
well on the pianoforte, and he himself could play on
it also. She was married to a lieutenant in the army
but he was promoted to be captain now. If he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>could he would go to see her in England, where he
had friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>He also said that he had an uncle in Liverpool, a
merchant. Then looking earnestly upon me, he
said, “My name is not Smith—my name is Henry
J. Moon. I was educated in Cambridge College, in
England. I understand English, French and Latin
well, and can speak and write five different
languages.” He also said he could write any hand
as handsome or as bad as I ever saw. He said he
had five hundred pounds in the Bank of England,
which was in the care of Mr. Turner, and that he
wished to have his wife get it, as he did not know
where he should go; but he knew he should meet
with trouble; yet he did not fear what man
could do to him, for he could but kill him, and he
should like to die here. After hearkening to these
incoherent observations for a length of time, without
being able to obtain an answer to any question
I put to him, I left him for that time.</p>

<p class='c012'>Smith Becomes a Fortune Teller and Startles the Gaoler—Foretells
His Own Release—Pardoned by the Court he Refuses to Leave
the Gaol which He Sets on Fire in a Mysterious Way—Finally
Shipped on a Schooner to Nova Scotia with his Marionettes.</p>

<div class='c008'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/ch8-capt.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The next morning, when the gaoler went in
to see him, Smith said he had been fishing,
and had caught a large fish. The gaoler,
on looking, perceived the chain which Smith had
formerly worn about his neck, and had been missing
a long time, but never could find out where or by
what means he concealed it. After this he commenced
a new scene of mystery, that of fortune-telling;
in which, if he did not possess the power
of divination, he was wonderfully successful.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gaoler carried him his breakfast, with tea;
Smith observed to him that he could tell him anything,
past or to come. The gaoler then asked him
to tell him something that had happened to him.
Smith replied,—“Some time ago you rode a great
way on my account, and carried letters and papers
about me, and about others too. Again you went
after a man, and you had to go on the water before
you found him, and I am not sure that you found
him on the water. While you were after him you
saw a man at work in the mud on the highway, and
you enquired of him, for the man you wanted. He
told you what you asked. You then asked him if
there was any water near, that you could drink.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>He told you of a place where he had drank; you
went to it, but found the water so bad you did not
drink it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gaoler was greatly astonished at this,
knowing the whole affair to be true just as he had
stated, and had no recollection of ever having
mentioned the circumstance to any person. Perhaps
all this may be attempted to be explained away in
some manner, or may be attributed merely to his
imagination, or the hazard of an opinion; but it
would be a coincidence not to be expected, and
very unlikely to happen. Besides, he often hit
upon a development of facts, which could not be
accounted for, but upon the supposition of some
mysterious knowledge of things beyond the reach
of common conception, as the following particulars
will fully testify:</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning, Aug. 13, he told me his own
fortune out of his tea-cup. After looking into the
cup for some time, he kissed it, and told the gaoler
he was going away from this place, that he was
going over the water, and must have a box to put
his family in; that he saw three papers that were
written and sent about him, and that one of them
was larger than the other two, and contained something
for him that he did not understand, but he
would soon know.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning, Aug. 14th, he looked in his
cup again, and told the gaoler that these papers
were on their way coming, and would be here this
day at 4 o’clock, and he would soon know what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>they contained about him. Accordingly I received
papers from Fredericton, containing his pardon, and
two letters just as he had predicted!!</p>

<p class='c009'>In addition to this, the following must be
regarded as a very singular and remarkable prediction,
which, independently of some unknown
mysterious means, cannot be accounted for. Early
in the morning he remarked to the gaoler in his
usual manner:</p>

<p class='c009'>“This man over the way has a son who has gone
to sea, and is at sea now; but he will be here this
night, and you shall see that I will affront him.”
Now mark the sequel. It so happened that a fresh
breeze springing up to the southward, with a strong
flood tide, the vessel which contained the young
man was alongside in the dock in St. John, on the
same day about two o’clock. He was then and
there informed that one of his sisters lay dangerously
ill at Kingston, and that Dr. Smith was just
going up to visit her. The young man hired a
horse, and in company with the doctor, arrived at
his father’s about the time that we usually visited
the prisoner in the evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>I called at Mr. Perkins’, and found that the
doctor and young Perkins had just arrived. The
doctor said to me that he had heard much of
my extraordinary prisoner, and if I had no objection,
he should be much pleased to see him and his
show, he had heard so much of his great performance.
Young Mr. Perkins said he would also like
to see the show, and all went with me into the gaol
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>and found Smith lying on his bed, but without
appearing to take notice of any one present. Mr.
Perkins, like everyone else, was much astonished at
the appearance of his show, as it was exhibited on the
wall, and had a great desire to see the performance.</p>

<p class='c009'>He put down a quarter dollar by Smith, and said
he would give it to him if he would make his
puppets dance; but Smith would not take any
notice of him, and young Perkins continued to
urge him to the performance, but without effect,
until now he was quite out of patience, and finally
took up his money, which he had proposed giving
for the exhibition, and left the gaol in quite an ill
humor. After Perkins left the gaol Smith said,
“now, if any of you want to see my family dance,
you may see them in welcome;”—and took up his
fiddle and went through the performance to the
entire satisfaction of all present.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the reader may account for this mysterious
prediction and its fulfilment upon whatever grounds
he pleases; but the arrival of the young man from
sea that day, his coming to Kingston, and his being
affronted by Smith in the jail, are facts which cannot
be disputed. The writer is aware that he may
incur the imputation of weakness for narrating some
things relative to the prisoner; but as they are all
characteristic of him, in a high degree, and when all
united, set him forth before the world as a character
singular and unprecedented, he considered that
every part of his sayings and doings had their
interest, and were necessary to be narrated.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>After closing the exhibition of his family for this
time, he went on to say, that he had told his fortune
from his tea-cup, and it came always alike; that he
could tell a great deal by dreams. The devil helped
fortune telling, he said, but dreams were the inspiration
of God. When the hogs came to him by night
he could tell a great deal by them. “Your
neighbor,” he said to me, “had a black sow that
had pigs, some black, some all white, and one with
red dots before and behind.” By them he said he
could tell much. I was aware that Mr. Perkins had
a sow with young pigs, and I had the curiosity to
look at them, but they did not answer to his
description, and I consequently allowed these
remarks of his relative to the sow and pigs to pass
for nothing. However, in the evening, as I was
leaving the jail, Smith said to me (and without a
word having been said about my looking at the
pigs.) “The pigs I told you about are not those
you examined, they were six months old.” I made
no reply, knowing that Mr. Scovil had a sow with
pigs, answering to his description in every
particular.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Saturday morning, Smith said to the jailer,
“Your neighbor over the way there, has a sow that
has gone away into the woods, and she has pups,—some
all black, some all white, and some black and
white, and she will come home before night, and
when she comes, she will have but one pig, and that
will be a plump black pig, and they will never know
what became of the others.” Accordingly, the sow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>about 4 o’clock, came home with her one “plump
black pig,” and was immediately driven back into
the woods the way by which she appeared to have
come; but according to the precise terms of Smith’s
prediction, the others were never found!</p>

<p class='c009'>The next evening after I had received his pardon
from Fredericton, I went to see him, and found
him, in bed, but he said he could not eat; asked
for some new potatoes, and remarked that the
jailer’s wife had new potatoes yesterday; and did
not appear in his usual good humor. Although he
would both talk and act at times rationally, yet he
had never recovered from his pretended insanity,
nor even until his release from my custody, thus
carrying out his scheme, in perfect wisdom, to the
last. But now, with the pardon in my hand, I
hoped to make some impression upon him, and if
possible, bring him to some sense of his situation,
by compassionately proposing my assistance to get
him out of the Province. I then proceeded to
inform him that I had received his pardon, that his
attorney had proved his friend, and had petitioned
the president and court, stating that he was a
young man, and this having been the first instance
of a case for horse-stealing before the court in this
Province, prayed that mercy might be extended
and his life spared; and that president and council
had been graciously pleased to withdraw the
sentence and grant his pardon; and that I was now
authorized to release him on his entering into
recognizance to appear in the Supreme court and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>plead his pardon when called upon. The only
reply made was, “I wish you would bring me some
new potatoes when you come again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I proceeded to say that as soon as he was ready,
and would let me know where he wished to go, I
would give him clothing, and would give him time
to put his family in order, and a box to put them
up in; observing that they might be a means of
getting him a living until he could find better
employment, without being driven to the necessity
of stealing.</p>

<p class='c009'>He replied. “Have you not got boys and girls
that wish to see my family dance? Bring all your
family to see them; I will show them as much as
you please, but others must pay.” I remained with
him nearly an hour afterwards without saying any
more on the subject of his <span class='sc'>Pardon</span>; during which
time he continued to talk incoherently as he had
done the evening before. That we must watch and
pray lest we enter into temptation; that he prayed
with his family; they could not pray for themselves;
that we must be spiritually minded, for to be spiritually
minded was life; but to be carnally minded
was death; and much more of this kind, repeating
large portions from the New Testament, nearly
whole chapters.</p>

<p class='c009'>He observed, “Now you see I can read as well to
you without the book as others can with the book.
I can read you almost all of any other chapter in
the Bible you will name, either in the Old or New
Testament, it makes not much difference; in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>dark as well as in the light. My wife is a good little
woman; she would get the Bible on Sunday, and
say to me, ‘Henry, come sit down and hear me read
the Bible’; but I would laugh, and tell her I could
read better without the book than she could with it,
and go out and look after my horse, or do anything
on Sundays. I have been a bad fellow; when I
was in England I gave all my attention to reading
my Bible, and became a great Methodist, and went
to all the Methodist meetings, and would pray and
exhort amongst them, and finally became a preacher
and preached in Brighton, Northampton, Southampton,
and in London; and great numbers
came to hear me. I was sometimes astonished to
see how many followed to hear me preach the
Scriptures, when I knew they were deceived. But
I did not follow preaching long in London.” He
went on to state his reasons for giving up preaching,
or rather the reasons that prevented his continuing
to preach. He had given himself up to the company
of lewd women, and had contracted the disease
common to such associations.</p>

<p class='c009'>A course like this could not remain long concealed,
and the issue was that he was prevented from
preaching, and was eventually obliged to leave
England, and come to this country. He went on to
say—“I have been a bad young man. I am young
now, only twenty-three years of age—not twenty-four
yet”; and did not know but he would preach
again; he could easily find converts; many would
like to hear him preach. When he was a preacher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>he was spiritually minded, and all was peace and
heaven to him; but ever since all was trouble,
and misery to him. He never intended to leave
this place; he was contented and willing to stay
here until he died; he was better off here than
anywhere else, and never wished to go into the
world again unless he was a preacher.</p>

<p class='c009'>After hearing him talk in this manner for some
time, I left him till the next day at noon, when I
went to the gaol again, and gave him a good dinner,
and read his pardon to him. When he saw the
paper, he said, “That looks like the paper which I
dreamed I saw, with two angels and a ship on it,
with something that looked like snakes.” When I
read his pardon he paid not the least attention to
the nature of it, but asked questions as foreign to
the nature of the subject as possible; only he said
he wished I would give him that paper; he dreamed
it was coming. I told him as soon as I would get
him some clothes made, I would give him the paper;
and that I would help him away with his show in a
box, and that he might not be driven to the necessity
of stealing; and in the evening I went with a tailor
to take his measure for a coat.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he saw the tailor with his measure, he said,
“I wish you would give me that ribbon in your
hand.” “It is no ribbon,” said the tailor, “but a
measure to measure you for a new coat; come stand
up.” “What!” said he, “do you think you are
tailor enough to make me a coat!” “Yes.” “But
you do not look like it; let me look at your hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>and fingers,” and upon seeing them, he added,
“you are no tailor, you look more like blacksmith,
you shall never make a coat for me,” and would not
be measured, but he said he would make it better
himself, and wished I would give him a candle to
work by, and he would make himself a waistcoat.</p>

<p class='c009'>He said I need not be afraid of his doing any
harm with the candle, he would put it in the middle
of the floor, and take care that his straw and chips
did not take fire and burn up his family, which he
could not live without, as he could not labor for his
living. Besides, he said, if he were so disposed, he
could burn up the house without a candle; for, said
he, I can make fire in one hour at any time. “When
I was a boy,” continued he, “every one took notice
of me as a very forward boy, and I obtained a
license for shooting when I was but fifteen. One
day when shooting I killed a rabbit on a farmer’s
land where I had no right. The old farmer came
after me, and I told him if he would come near me
I would knock him down, but he caught me, and
tied me fast to a large stack of faggots, and sent for
a constable. While he was gone I made fire, and
burned up the whole stack, and got off clear; but
the old farmer never knew how the faggots took fire.
You do not use faggots in this country—they are
little sticks tied up in bundles, and sold to boil the
tea-kettle with; and if I would give him a candle,
he would make a fire to light it. Accordingly I
provided materials for his clothes, and a lighted
candle to work by. He continued to sew by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>light of the candle but a short time and put it away
from him, and said he could see better without it;
he completed his waistcoat in the neatest manner,
and occasionally attended to the improvement of
his family.”</p>

<p class='c009'>August 29th, at evening, many persons came to
see his performance, as was usual, and when they
were all gone out, he told me that he had carved a
new figure of Bonaparte; that the first he had made
after his own image and likeness, for he was the
man after his own heart, but he had fallen. God,
he said, made man out of the dust of the earth, but
he had made man out of the wood of the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had now been in my custody more than a
year, and almost every day developed some new
feature of his character, or produced some fresh
effort of his genius. I had had much trouble with
him, and my patience often severely tried; but now
I viewed him rather as an object of commiseration,
and I could not think of turning him out of the
gaol naked, destitute and friendless. In such a
situation he must starve or steal, so that his pardon
and release must become rather a curse than a
blessing. I represented these things as feelingly as
I could to him, gave him a box to put his family in,
and told him he must be ready to leave the Province
on Tuesday morning, and I would procure him a
passage either to Nova Scotia or the United States.
To all this he gave no attention, but asked some
frivolous questions about Mohawks and snakes, and
acted the fool, so that I began to conclude that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>would now have much more trouble to get him out
of gaol than I formerly had to keep him in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day Judge Pickett and Judge Micheau
attended at the court house, to take the recognizances
required of him to appear and plead his
pardon when called upon to do so. After divesting
him of his irons, and furnishing him with decent
clothing, it was with much difficulty I could
prevail on him to leave the gaol. However, he
finally took one of his family in one hand, and a
pair of scissors in the other, and with much effort
we got him up into one of the jury rooms, when
Judge Micheau read his pardon to him, and
explained all the circumstances which united to
produce it, to which, as usual, he gave no attention,
but looked about the room and talked of something
else.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judge Pickett required his recognizance, and
informed him that if he did not leave the Province
immediately he would be taken and tried on two
indictments in the county of York. He took no
notice of what was said, but talked and danced
about the room, told the judge he looked like a
tailor, and asked him to give him his shoe string.
His pardon, lying on the table, he caught hold of,
and before it could be recovered from him, he
clipped off the seal with the scissors; he said he
wanted the ship that was on it to carry him away
with his family. He tore the collar off his coat, and
cut it in pieces with the scissors. Finding that
nothing else could be done with him, I returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>him again into prison, when he said to us that for
our using him so kindly, he would, for one shilling,
show us all his performance with his family. Upon
which Judge Micheau gave him half a dollar, and
told him to return a quarter dollar change, and
then he would have more than a shilling. He
took it, and said it was a nice piece of money, and
put it in his pocket, but the judge could not make
him understand the meaning of change.</p>

<p class='c009'>He then performed the exhibition in fine style,
but when we were leaving him he seemed out of
humor with Judge Pickett, and told him that he
had thrown stones at him, that he would burn his
house, and that this place would be in flames before
morning. He could make a fire in half an hour,
and wanted a fire, and would have a fire, and I
should see that he could make fire. Upon which
we left him, without apprehending anything from
his threats more than usual.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the next day, the 29th, when entering the
gaol for the purpose of preparing for his removal,
I perceived that there was much smoke in the hall,
which I supposed had come from the gaoler’s room,
but he said that no smoke had been caused that
morning, but that it proceeded from the prison door.
I immediately opened the door, and found Smith
sitting quite unconcerned before a fire which he
had made with the chips of his carved work, and
other materials. He observed to me that fire was
very comfortable, that he had not seen any before
for a long time, that he had made the fire with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>own hands, and that he could make it again in ten
minutes; that he could not do without one. I
immediately extinguished the fire, and shut him up
in the suffocating smoke, which did not seem to
give him the least inconvenience. The account of
his having made the fire excited the neighbors,
who came in to see the feat. I ordered him to put
his family into his box immediately; he took no
notice of my orders. I hastily took down one of
them, and laid it in his box, at which he seemed
pleased, and said he would put them all in that
box, and began to take them down very actively,
observing that he did not want assistance from any
one, but leave him with the light and he would
have them all ready in half an hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>We left him with the candle, and returning in
about an hour, found him walking the floor, and
every thing he had packed up in the box very
neatly. It was remarkable to see with what skill
and ingenuity he had packed them up. I gave
him a pair of new shoes and with the box on his
shoulders, he marched off to the boat that I had
prepared for his conveyance, and with three men in
the boat we set out with him for the city of
Saint John. On the way he told the gaoler, if he
would give him but one dollar he would teach him
the way to make fire on any occasion. Receiving
no reply from the gaoler, he commenced preaching,
praying, and singing hymns, and sometimes acting
as if crazy, during the passage down. We made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>no stop by the way, and reached Saint John about
8 o’clock in the evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>On his perceiving the moon as she made her
appearance between two clouds, he observed that
here was a relation of his that he was glad to see;
that he had not seen one of his name for a long
time. On our arrival at the prison in Saint John,
he said he must have a hot supper with tea, and
then wished to be locked up in a strong room,
where he might have all his family out to take the
air to-night, else they would all die in that box
before morning. However, we found all the rooms
in the prison occupied, or undergoing repairs, so
that there was no place to confine him. I directed
the gaoler to provide him with his supper, while I
would call upon the sheriff to know what would be
done with him for the night, and how he would be
disposed of in the morning. I understood from
the sheriff that there was no vessel to sail for the
States for some days, and therefore made up my
mind that I should send him to Nova Scotia. When
I returned to the gaol I found Smith at his supper;
when he had finished his tea, he looked into his
cup and remarked that he must not disturb his
family to-night; that he there saw the vessel, then
lying at the wharf, that would carry him to his
wife—and there would be crying. While in confinement,
the following letter was received from
his wife:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Dear Husband</span>—I received your letter of the
22nd Oct., 1815. You say you have sent several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>letters—if you have, I have never received them.
You wish me to come and see you, which I would
have done, if I had got the letter in time; but I
did not know whether you were in Kingston or not.
My dear, do not think hard of me that I do not
come to see you—if you write back to me I shall
come immediately. My dear, as soon as you receive
this letter send me an answer, that I may know
what to do; so no more at present, but that I remain
your loving and affectionate wife.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c014'>
    <div>H. F. M. S., Kingston.            <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span> P. M. S.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The gaoler, by direction of the sheriff, cleared
out a small room above stairs, with an iron-grated
window where we confined him, with his family,
for the night. On the next morning, the 30th of
August, finding that there was no vessel bound for
the States, I determined to send him to Nova Scotia;
and happening to meet with my friend, Mr. Daniel
Scovil, he informed me that he had a vessel then
lying at the wharf, which would sail for Windsor,
Nova Scotia, in half an hour. I accordingly
prevailed on him to take Smith on board, which was
done without loss of time, and at high water the
vessel hauled off from the wharf, to my great
satisfaction and relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the vessel was getting under weigh, Smith
was in the cabin alone, and seeing a great number
of chain traces lying on the cabin floor, he took them
up and threw them all out of the cabin window!
“Because,” said he, “they would get about my
neck again.” During the passage he appeared very
active; he played on his fife and was quite an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>agreeable passenger. But on the vessel’s arrival at
Windsor, he left her immediately without any
ceremony; and notwithstanding the very strong
regard which he had always possessed for his
family as he called them, he left them also, and
everything else that he had brought with him. He
was seen only a very short time in Windsor before
he entirely disappeared, and never was known to be
there afterwards, but was seen at some distance
from Windsor, in several other places, and
recognized by many, but always carefully evaded
being spoken to.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
After having made his appearance in
different parts of Nova Scotia, he called at
a certain house one morning, on a bye-road,
and ordered breakfast, and asked for a towel also,
and a piece of soap that he might wash at a small
brook that was near the house. The woman of the
house, and a maid, were the only persons in the
house at the time. Smith left a large bundle, which
he carried, on a chest which was standing in the
room, and went out to wash. The bundle presented
rather a singular appearance, and attracted the
young woman’s notice, so that she said to the other:
“I wonder what he has in that bundle. If you will
keep watch at the window while he is washing at
the brook, I will open and see what is in it.” They
did so and found a great number of watches, of
which they counted fifteen, with many other
valuable articles.</p>

<p class='c009'>She tied up the bundle again, and placed it where
he had left it and said, “This man has stolen these
watches.” When he came in, he handed the towel
to the young woman, and said, “There were just
fifteen watches, were there?” and with such an
expression of countenance, that she could not refrain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>from answering, “Yes.” “But,” said he, “you
were mistaken about my stealing them, for I came
honestly by them.” Upon which the young woman
instantly recognized him to be Henry More Smith,
and concluded that he was collecting his “hidden
treasure,” which he had deposited while he was in
Roden.</p>

<p class='c009'>This information I received from Mrs. Beckwith,
a respectable lady from Nova Scotia, who resided
at the time in that neighborhood, who also said it
was not known that he had ever seen his wife at
that time, from the time of his release from
confinement. The next account I heard of him
stated that he had been seen on board of a plaster
vessel at Eastport, but he was not known to have
been on shore during the time she remained there.
He employed himself while on board engraving a
number of small articles, some of which he made
presents of to young ladies who chanced to come
on board.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was next seen at Portland, by a gentleman who
had known him at Kingston; nothing, however,
transpired there concerning him, only that he was
travelling with considerable weight of baggage
through the State of Maine, which gave rise to the
following ludicrous story, which I saw published
at Eastport, of a Mysterious Stranger travelling in
a stage. One cold and stormy night, the bar-room
of an hotel was filled with sturdy farmers
surrounding a cheerful fire, and discussing the
affairs of state over a mug of flip. The night having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>been tremendously stormy and wet, the wind
whistling all around the house, and making every
door and window rattle, the landlord expressed
much fear for the safety of the stage coach; but
suddenly the sound of a distant stage-horn
announced the approach of the coach and removed
the landlord’s anxiety. He replenished the fire,
that the approaching travellers might have as warm
a retreat as possible from the unusual inclemency
of the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some time passed, and yet the expected coach did
not come up. The landlord’s fears grew up anew,
and with an expression of concern he put the
question around, “Did not some of you hear a
horn?” and added, “I have expected the stage a
long time, and I thought that a few minutes ago I
heard the horn near at hand; but I fear that
something has happened in the gale that has caused
it to be thus belated.” “I thought I heard the
stage-horn some time ago,” answered the arch
young farmer Hopkins; “but then you must know
that ghosts and witches are very busy on such nights
as this, and what kind of pranks they may cut up
we cannot tell. You know the old adage,—“Busy
as the devil in a gale of wind.” Now who knows
but they may have——” Here he was interrupted
by the sudden opening of the door, accompanied by
a violent gust of wind and the dashing of rain, when
in rushed from the fury of the storm, drenched with
wet from head to foot, a tall stranger, dressed in a
fur cap and shaggy great coat.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>From an impulse of politeness and respect, not
unmingled with fear, all arose on his entrance,—the
expression “The devil in a gale of wind,” rushing
upon their minds with a signification to which
a profound silence gave expressive utterance. The
stranger noticed their reserved yet voluntary
respect with a slight nod, and proceeded to disencumber
himself of his wet clothes and warm his
fingers by the fire. By this time the driver entered
bearing the baggage of his passenger. “The worst
storm I was ever troubled with blowing right in my
teeth, and I guess the gentleman there found it the
same.” Here a low whisper ensued between the
driver and the landlord, from which an unconnected
word or phrase dropped upon the ear of the
inmates. “Don’t know,—came in the,—as rich
as a mine,” &amp;c. Upon this information the landlord
immediately took his wet garments and hung
them carefully before the fire. “I hope that your
wetting will not injure your health, sir.” “I
hardly think it will, my good friend; I am no child
to catch cold from a ducking.” “Shall I show you
a room, sir?” said the landlord. “We can let you
have as good a room and as comfortable a supper as
any in the country.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The stranger was immediately conducted into a
handsome parlor, in which blazed a cheerful fire;
and in a short time a smoking supper was placed on
the board. After supper was over, he called the
landlord into his room, and sent for his trunk. “I
like your accommodations,” accosting the landlord,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“and if you like my proposals equally well, I will
be your guest for some time, though I know not
how long. Nay, I shall stay at any price you please—but
remember, I must have my rooms to myself,
and they must not be entered without my leave;
and whatever I do, no questions to be asked. Do
you consent to these terms?” “I do sir,” replied
the landlord, “and you shall not have cause to
complain of your treatment.” “Very well,”
rejoined the stranger, “then the agreement is
completed. You may go now.” “Yes, sir,”
replied the landlord, “but what may I call your
name, sir?” “Beware, you have broken the
bargain already,” replied the stranger. “I forgive
you for this once only; now ask no more questions,
or you will certainly drive me from your house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After this the landlord returned to his bar-room,
from which the merry farmers had not yet withdrawn,
but were endeavoring to penetrate the
mystery that hung around the stranger. “Well,
landlord,” said the arch Hopkins, “what do you
make him out to be?” “That is a question I dare
hardly answer. He is a gentleman, for he does not
grudge his money.” “I would not think he
should,” replied Hopkins, shaking his head
mysteriously. “And why not?” exclaimed several
of the company. “Ah, just as I thought,” returned
Hopkins, with another shake of the head and significant
look at the landlord. “What, in the name of
all that’s silly, is the matter with you, Hopkins?”
exclaimed the landlord. “What on earth can you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>know?” “I know what I know,” was his reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rather doubtful, that,” rejoined the landlord.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You doubt it,” returned Hopkins, rather warmly;
“then I will tell you what I think him to be;
he is nothing more or less than a pirate; and
you will all be murdered in your beds, Smith,
(which was the landlord’s name,) you and your
whole family, before morning. Now what think
you of your guest?”</p>

<p class='c009'>All the company stood aghast, and stared at each
other in silence for some time, until the landlord
again ventured to interrupt the silence by asking
Hopkins “How do you know all that?” Hopkins
answered, in rather a silly manner, “I guessed
at it,” which did away with the effect produced
by his previous assertions; and the landlord
dismissing his fears, exclaimed, “As long as
he pays well, be he man or devil, he shall stay here.”
“A praiseworthy conclusion,” proceeded from a
voice at the back part of the room, and at that instant
the mysterious stranger stood before them. All
started to their feet, seized their hats and waited to
ask no questions, nor make additional comments,
but went home and told their wives of Smith’s guest,
and Hopkins’ opinion of his character.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every woman fastened her door that night with
suspicious care, and the mysterious stranger, and
the delineation of his real character by Hopkins,
became a subject of general conversation and comment
throughout the village, and gradually became
the received opinion among all the settlers, so that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>they set down the mysterious stranger for what
Hopkins guessed him to be, and concluded that the
articles which composed his baggage could not have
been obtained honestly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The stranger, finding now the conversation
turned upon him, did not think it prudent to protract
his stay in this place, and proceeding to Boston
in the coach, was known from that time by the name
of Maitland. He reached Boston about the 1st of
November, where it was supposed he must have, in
some way, disposed of much of his treasures.
From thence he proceeded for New York; on the
7th November arrived at New Haven in the Boston
stage coach, by the way of New London, with a
large trunk full of clothing, a small portable desk,
and money in his pockets. He was dressed in a
handsome frock coat, with breeches, and a pair of
top boots, and remained at the steamboat hotel
several days. While he remained there, he always
ate his meals alone, and preferred being alone in
different parts of the hotel at different times, every
part of which he had an opportunity of becoming
acquainted with, while he remained waiting for the
arrival of the steamer from New York.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hotel was then kept by Mr. Henry Butler;
and, as it afterwards appeared, the traveller
found his way by means of keys, into Mr.
Butler’s desk and sideboards, as well as every
part of the house. He left New Haven in the
steamboat at 5 a.m. on the 10th November, 1815.
After his departure from New Haven, Mr. Butler’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>servants discovered that their whole quantity of
silver spoons, to the number of four or five dozen,
which had been carefully put away in a side-board
was missing, and not to be found on the premises;
and it was found, upon further search by Mr. Butler,
that a watch and several other articles, with money
from the desk, had sympathetically decamped with
the spoons. Mr. Butler imagined that the theft
must be chargeable on some lodger in the hotel,
and immediately fixed his suspicions upon Smith,
whose appearance and movements about the house
furnished suspicions too strong to pass unnoticed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Butler, without loss of time, set out for
New York, and arriving there before the boat that
carried the adventurer, he furnished himself with
proper authority, and boarded the boat in the
stream. After Mr. Butler had made some enquiries
of Captain Bunker, who could not identify the
traveller among all his passengers, Smith made his
appearance from some part of the engine room and
was immediately ordered by Mr. Butler to open his
trunk, with which he complied unhesitatingly; but
the trunk did not disclose the expected booty.
There was, however, in the trunk a very neat
portable writing desk, which he refused to open,
and Mr. Butler could not find out how it was
fastened. However, he called for an axe to split it
open, upon which Smith said, “I will show you,”
and, touching a spring, the lid flew open. The
desk contained a set of neat engraving tools, with
old silver rings and jewelry, amongst which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Mr. Butler perceived a small ear-ring, which he
supposed belonged to a young lady that had slept
in his house, and laid her ear-rings on a stand at
the head of her bed, which were missing the next
morning. After her departure one of the rings
was found at the door of the hotel. Upon the
evidence of this single ear-ring, he was arrested and
put into the Bridewell in the city of New York.</p>

<p class='c009'>The keeper of the Bridewell at that time was
Archimial Allen, an old friend of mine, and a man
of respectable character. On my visit to New York
afterwards, I called on Mr. Allen, and enquired the
particulars concerning W. H. Newman, (for this
was the name he had assumed then) while in his
custody. He informed me that when he was put
in he behaved for some time very well; that he
offered him a book; but he could neither read nor
write a word. He soon began to complain of being
sick from confinement, raised blood, and seemed so
ill that a doctor attended him, but could not tell
what was the matter with him. However, he kept
up the farce of being ill until he was removed from
Bridewell to New Haven, there to take his trial at
the Supreme court in January.</p>

<p class='c009'>His change of situation had the effect, as it would
seem, of restoring his health, which brought along
with it that display of his ingenuity which the
peculiarity of his new situation seemed to call forth.
During the period of his confinement at New Haven,
he amused himself by carving two images—one
representing himself, and the other Butler, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>attitude of fighting. And so mechanically had he
adjusted this production of his genius, that he
would actually cause them to fight, and make the
image representing himself knock down that of
Butler, to the wonder and amusement of many that
came to see him. By his insinuating manner and
captivating address, he not only drew forth the
sympathies of those who came to visit him, but even
gained so far upon their credulity, as to induce a
belief that he was innocent of the crime with which
he was charged.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lapse of a few days, however, made
impressions of a different nature. The January
Court term drew nigh, at which our prisoner was
to receive his trial, but on the very eve of his trial,
and after the Court had been summoned, he, by the
power of a mind which seldom failed him in the
hour of emergency, contrived and effected his
escape in the following curious and singular
manner. And here it will be necessary to give
some description of the prison, with the situation
of the apartments, which the writer was himself, by
the politeness of the keeper, permitted to survey.
There was a wide hall leading from the front of
the County House, and from this hall, two separate
prisons were entered by their respective doors;
between these doors a timber partition crossed the
hall, having in it a door also, to allow an entrance
to the inner prison. The object in having this
partition, was to prevent any intercourse between
the two prison doors, and it was so placed as to leave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>a distance of about two feet on each side between
it and the prison doors respectively. Newman,
(for this it will be remembered is the name by
which our prisoner is now known); was confined
in the inner prison.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doors of the prison opened by shoving
inwards, and when shut were secured by two strong
bolts, which entered into stone posts, with clasps
lapped over a staple, to which were fixed strong
padlocks. These padlocks, our prisoner, by some
means, managed to open or remove, so that he
could open the door at pleasure, and fix the padlocks
again in so geniously, that it could not be detected
from their appearance. On the night of the 12th
January, at the usual time of feeding the prisoners,
Newman, availing himself of these adjustments,
opened his door, came out, and replacing the locks,
took his stand behind the door of the partition,
which, when open, would conceal him from
observation. The prisoners in the other apartments
received their supply first, and the instant when
the servant was proceeding from the door to go and
bring Newman’s supper, he stepped through the
partition door, which had been first opened and
not shut again, and followed the servant softly
through the hall to the front door, and walked away
undiscovered! When the servant returned with
his supper to the wicket, she called him, but receiving
no answer, placed his supper inside of the
wicket, saying, “you may take it or leave it; I am
not going to wait here all night.” She then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>secured the outer door, and so the matter rested till
the morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning, finding that the prisoner had
not taken his supper, the servant observed to the
keeper, that she feared Newman was dead, for he
had not taken his supper; and she called him, but
could not hear or see anything of him. Upon this,
the keeper came with his keys to unlock the door,
and to his utter astonishment, found both locks
broken and the prison empty. The keeper made
known the matter to the sheriff, and on the 13th,
the day subsequent to his escape, the following
notice was inserted in the Connecticut Journal:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Beware of a Villain!</span>—One of the most
accomplished villains that disgraces our country,
broke from the jail in this city on Friday evening
last, between the hours of five and six o’clock, and
succeeded in making his escape. The fellow calls
himself Newman, and was bound over for trial at
the sitting of the next Supreme Court, on the charge
of burglary, having robbed the house of Mr. Butler,
of plate, money, etc. He is supposed to be an
Englishman, and is undoubtedly a most profound
adept in the arts of knavery and deception. He
speaks the English and French languages fluently,
and can play off the air of a genteel Frenchman with
the most imposing gravity. He is of middling
stature, slender and active, and appears to possess
an astonishing variety of genius. He is sick or well,
grave or gay, silent or loquacious, and can fence,
box, fight, run, sing, dance, play, whistle, or talk,
as occasion suits. He amused himself while in
prison, by making and managing a puppet show,
which he performed apparently with such means as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>to excite the wonder of the credulous, having a
piece of an old horse-shoe, whetted on the wall of
his dungeon, as the only instrument of his
mechanism, and complaining only of the scarcity
of timber to complete his group. He had the
address, by an irresistable flow of good humor and
cheerfulness, to make some believe that he was quite
an innocent and harmless man; and excited
sympathy enough in those who had the curiosity to
see him, to obtain several gratifications which
prisoners do not usually enjoy; yet the depth of
his cunning was evinced in accomplishing his
means of escape, which he effected by sawing a hole
in the prison door, which is several inches thick, so
neatly, that the block could be taken out and
replaced without any marks of violence. Through
this hole he could thrust his arm, and by wrenching
off strong padlocks, and shoving back the bolts, at
the hour of supper, when the person who waited on
the prisoners was giving them their food, found a
free passage to the hall of the counting house, and
thence to the street.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The saw which he used in cutting the door of the
prison, is supposed to have been one which he stole
on board the steamboat Fulton, on his passage from
New York to New Haven, and so artfully did he
conceal the saw, though repeatedly searched both
before and after his confinement, at the suggestion
of Capt. Bunker, that he retained it about his person
until by its means he effected his escape.</p>

<p class='c009'>About the time that Newman made his elopement,
Mr. Butler happened to be in New York, and
on his return by land, he met Newman travelling
leisurely along, a few miles distant from the city.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Mr. Butler readily recognized him, and immediately
instituted a pursuit, but he baffled his attempt to
apprehend him and made his retreat into the
woods. Upon this Mr. Butler engaged a party of
men, with dogs and fire-arms to ferret him out if
possible, but he had vigilance and art sufficient to
elude their efforts to take him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning after the chase, he made his
appearance at a certain house, where he found the
table placed for the family breakfast, and without
invitation or ceremony, sat down at the table and
began to eat. While he was eating he observed to
the family, that he would not let them take him
yesterday—referring to his pursuers. “Was it
you they were after?” enquired some of the family.
“Yes, but I would not let them find me.” “How
came you from New Haven?” was next enquired.
“I staid a great while,” he replied, “but they did
not find anything against me, only that a young
woman pretended to say that I had an ear-ring of
hers which belonged to my wife, which was not
worth waiting for, and so I came away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here, however, he was apprehended, and sent
again to Bridewell; but when he came there, he
denied being the man, and had so altered his
appearance and dress, that no one knew him, until
Mr. Allen, the keeper of the prison at New Haven,
came and recognized him. He took him in charge at
the Bridewell and returned with him to New Haven
in the steamboat. On his arrival at the county
house, the sheriff had him closely searched, to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>that he had no saws, or any other instruments by
which he might effect another escape. After the
search, he was confined in the criminal’s room,
handcuffed, with a shackle about one of his legs, to
which was attached a long iron chain firmly stapled
to the floor, and in company with two negro boys
who were confined for stealing.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this situation he was left in the evening; and
the next morning, when the keeper came to the
door of his prison, he found him walking the room
smoking his pipe, with the chain on his shoulder,
and the handcuffs in his hand, which he presented
to the keeper, saying, “you may take these, they
may be of use to you, for they are of no use to me.”
The keeper, on attempting to open the door, found
that he had not only drawn the staple, but had
raised the floor also, which was of strong plank
firmly fastened to the sleepers with spikes. The
heads of some of the spikes were drawn through the
planks which he had taken up, and with which he
had so barricaded the door that the keeper
attempted in vain to enter. Upon this, he called
upon the sheriff, who came and ordered the prisoner
to open the door, to which he replied from within,
“My house is my castle, and none shall enter alive
without my leave.” The sheriff then ordered the
two colored boys (who stood trembling with fear)
to come and remove the fastening from the door,
but the prisoner told them that death would be
their portion if they attempted it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>The sheriff finding him determined not to open
the door, and having attempted in vain to get in
by other means, sent for a mason, and ordered him
to break an opening through the brick partition
which divided the lower room. When the mason
commenced operations on the wall, Newman said to
the sheriff, “It is no use to make a hole through
the wall, for I could kill every vagabond as fast as
they put their heads in, but if the sheriff will
bring no one in but gentlemen, I will open the
door for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The door was then opened, and the sheriff went
in and secured him; and soon after, more strongly,
with additional irons and chains. Finding himself
now overpowered, and another escape rather hopeless,
he had recourse to his old scheme of yelling
and screaming like anything but the human voice,
and seemingly in every part of the house. This he
kept up all night, until the whole town was literally
alarmed. A special court was therefore immediately
called, and in a few days he was brought to his
trial.</p>

<p class='c009'>The trial was brought on as a case of burglary,
the prisoner having entered a chamber of Mr.
Butler’s, and stole an ear-ring belonging to a young
lady then lodging at the house. Newman obtained
counsel to plead his case; but not being satisfied
with the manner in which the trial was conducted,
he pleaded his own case, in which he maintained
that the ear-ring did not belong to the lady, but to
his own wife; that very <i>like</i> was not the same, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>that the evidence before the court did not establish
the charge. He was found guilty, however, and
sentenced to three years confinement in the Newgate,
Simsbury Mines, which was considered rather a
stretch of power, on account of his infamous and
notorious character. He was consequently sent off
next day to the place of his future confinement and
labor, ironed and chained, and in a wagon under a
strong guard.</p>

<p class='c012'>Seen in the Connecticut Prison by Sheriff Bates He Denies That

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
After I arrived in New Haven, where I was
put in possession of these particulars concerning
him, no person was known in the
United States who could identify him to be the noted
Henry More Smith but myself. I was consequently
requested, for the gratification of the public, to go to
Simsbury Mines to see him. I had the curiosity to
see how he conducted himself at Newgate, and proceeded
to Simsbury, about fifty miles, for the purpose.
On my arrival at Simsbury, I enquired of Capt.
Washburn, the keeper of the prison, how Newman
conducted himself. He answered that he behaved
very well; that he heard that he was a very bad
fellow, but he had so many that were worse he did
not think anything bad in Newman. I further
enquired of the keeper what account Newman gave
of himself, and what he acknowledged to have been
his occupation. His answer to these enquiries
were, that he professed to be a tailor, if anything,
but he had not been accustomed to much hard
work, as he had always been subject to fits; that
his fits were frightful, and that in his agony and
distress he would turn round on his head and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>shoulders like a top, and he was so bruised and
chafed with his irons in his convulsive agonies, that
he had taken the shackles off his legs, so that now
he had only one on one leg. This was as convincing
to me as possible that he was my old friend Smith.</p>

<p class='c009'>The captain asked me if I had a wish to liberate
him. I replied, my object was to ascertain whether
he were a prisoner I had in my custody more than
twelve months, and that if he were, he would know
me immediately, but would not profess to know me.
Accordingly, when he was brought into my presence
in the captain’s room, he maintained a perfect
indifference, and took no notice of me whatever. I
said to him, “Newman, what have you been doing
that has brought you here?” “Nothing,” said he,
“I had an ear-ring with me that belonged to my
wife, and a young lady claimed it and swore it
belonged to her, and I had no friend to speak in
favor of me, and they sent me to prison.” I then
asked him whether he had ever seen me before. He
looked earnestly upon me and said, “I do not know
but I have seen you at New Haven, there were
many men at court.” “Where did you come from?”
His reply was, “I came from Canada.” “What
countryman are you?” “A Frenchman, born in
France.” He had been in London and Liverpool,
but never at Brighton. “Was you ever at Kingston,
New Brunswick?” He answered, “No, he did
not know where that was,” with a countenance as
unmoved as if he had spoken in all the confidence
of truth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>He appeared rather more fleshy than when at
Kingston; but still remained the same subtle,
mysterious being.  I understood that he was the
first that had ever effected an exemption from labor
in that prison by or on any pretence whatever. He
kept himself clean and decent, and among the
wretched victims who were daily brought from the
horrid pit in chains and fetters to their daily labor
of making nails, William Newman appeared quite
a distinguished character. So obtuse was he that
he could not be taught to make a nail, and yet so
ingenious was he, that he made a jew’s harp to the
greatest perfection, without being discovered at
work and without its being known until he was
playing on it.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was in the city of New Haven that the
author published the first edition of these Memoirs,
being aware that here, where his character
and unprecedented actions were perfectly known
throughout the country, the publication of his
doings at Kingston, and his career throughout
the Provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
would not only be desirable and acceptable, but
would also be received with less scrupulousness,
when brought, as it were, in contact with facts of a
similar nature publicly known and believed.</p>

<p class='c009'>While these papers were being prepared for the
press, a gentleman from Washington, Major
McDaniel, on his return from Boston, boarded some
time in the same house with me, that of Mr. Joseph
Nichols, and having heard some details from me of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>his unprecedented character and actions in New
Brunswick, and having also become acquainted
with the facts relating to his imprisonment and
escape, etc., in that place, could not repress his
curiosity in going to see him, and requested me to
accompany him at his own expense. He observed
that it would be a high gratification to him, on his
return to Washington, that he would not only have
one of my books with him, but would also be able
to say that he had personally seen the sheriff from
New Brunswick that had written the book, and had
seen the remarkable character in the prison of
Newgate that had constituted the subject of the
book, and also the prison of New Haven from which
he escaped.</p>

<p class='c009'>Accordingly we set out from Newgate, and my
friend had the satisfaction of seeing the noted
Henry More Smith, now William Newman. On
our leaving him, I said to him, “Now, Smith, if
you have anything you wish to communicate to
your wife, I will let her know it.” He looked at
me and said, “Sir, are you going to the Jerseys?”
“Why do you think your wife is there?” “I hope
so; I left her there,” was his reply, and that with
as much firmness and seeming earnestness as if he
had never before seen my face. After I had left
him and returned to New Haven, and furnished the
printer with this additional sketch, and had the
Memoirs completed, one of the books was shown to
him, which he perused with much attention and
replied with seeming indifference that there never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>was such a character in existence, but that some
gentleman travelling in the United States had run
short of money, and had invented that book to
defray his expenses!</p>

<p class='c009'>Immediately after he had read the Memoirs of his
own unparalleled life and actions, and pronounced
the whole a fiction, as if to outdo anything before
recited of him, or attributed to him, he added the
following remarkable feat to the list, already so full
of his singular and unprecedented actions. In the
presence of a number of young persons, and when
there was a fine fire burning on the hearth, he
affected to be suddenly seized with a violent
convulsive fit, falling down on the floor and
bounding and writhing about as if in the most
agonizing suffering. And what constituted the
wonder of this masterpiece of affectation was, that
in his spasmodic contortions his feet came in contact
with the fire, and were literally beginning to be
roasted, without his appearing to feel any pain from
the burning. This circumstance confirmed the
belief in the bystanders that the fit was a reality;
and he did not miss his aim in showing off his
spasmodic attack, which was indeed done to the
life. He was consequently exempted from hard
labor, and was permitted to employ himself in any
trifling occupation he chose, or in making jew’s
harps, pen-knives, knives of various descriptions,
and rings, in the mechanism of which he displayed
much original talent and characteristic ingenuity.
Many persons, from mere curiosity, purchased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>among the rest may be instanced the case of two
young men, who very much admired his small
pen-knives, and proposed purchasing two of them
on condition of his engraving his name on the
handles of them. He immediately engraved, with
perfect neatness, “Henry More Smith,” on one side
of one of them, “William Newman,” on the other
side, and on the other knife he engraved,
“Mysterious Stranger.” These knives were kept
by their owners as curiosities, and many persons
were much gratified by seeing them. One of them
was sometime after brought to Kingston, and I
myself had the gratification of seeing the name of
my old domestic engraved on the handle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Under the indulgent treatment he received in
Newgate, he became perfectly reconciled to his
situation, manifesting no desire to leave it.
“Contentment” he said, “is the brightest jewel in
this life, and I was never more contented in my
life.” Consequently he never attempted any means
of escape.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the period of his imprisonment was up,
and he had received his discharge, he left with the
keeper of the prison a highly finished pocket-knife,
of moderate size, the handle of which contained a
watch, complete in all its parts, keeping time
regularly. And what excited much wonder in
reference to this ingenious and singularly curious
piece of mechanism, was the fact that he had never
been found at work on any part of the watch or
knife, and yet there was no doubt in the minds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>those who saw it that it was in reality the production
of his own genius, and the work of his own hands.
For this information I was indebted to a gentleman
named Osborne, who resided in the neighbourhood,
and who stated that he had seen the watch and
knife himself, and that it was regarded by all as a
most wonderful piece of ingenuity.</p>

<p class='c009'>He left Simsbury decently apparelled, and with
some money in his pocket, and in possession of
some articles of his own handiwork. He directed
his course eastward, and was seen in Boston; but
for some time nothing particular or striking was
heard of him. The first thing concerning him, that
arrested public attention, was published in the
Boston Bulletin, and which came under my own
eye:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Beware of Pickpockets!</span>—As the stage coach,
full of passengers, was on its way to this city a few
evenings since, one of the passengers rang the bell,
and cried out to the driver to stop his horses, as his
pockets had been picked of a large sum of money
since he entered the coach; and at the same time
requested the driver would not let any of the
passengers get out of the coach; it being dark, until
he, the aforesaid passenger, should bring a light
in order to have a general search. This caused a
general feeling of pockets among the passengers,
when another passenger cried out that his pocket-book
had also been stolen. The driver did as
directed until the gentleman who first spoke should
have time to have procured a lamp, but whether he
found it or not remained quite uncertain. But no
doubt he found the light he intended should answer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>his purpose, as he did not make his appearance in
any other light. However the passenger who really
lost his pocket-book, which, although it did not
contain but a small amount of money, thinks he
shall hereafter understand what is meant when a
man in a stage coach calls out thief, and that he will
prefer darkness rather than light, if ever such an
evil joke is offered to be played with him again.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he was continually changing his name, as well
as his place, it was impossible always to identify
his person, especially as few persons in the United
States were personally acquainted with him. The
difficulty of recognizing him was not a little
increased also by the circumstances of his continually
changing his external appearance; and the
iniquitous means by which he could obtain money
and change of apparel, always afforded him a
perfect facility of assuming a different appearance.
In addition to these circumstances also, as a
feature of character which no less contributed
to the difficulty of identifying him, must be taken
into account his unequalled and inimitable ease
in affecting different and various characters, and
his perfect and unembarrassed composure in the
most difficult and perplexing circumstances. To
the identity and eccentricity, therefore, of his
actions, rather than to our knowledge of the
identity of his person and name, we must depend,
in our future attempts to trace his footsteps and mark
their characteristic points.</p>

<p class='c009'>On this ground, therefore, there is not the shadow
of a doubt that the robbery committed in the stage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>coach, and that the originality of the means by
which he carried off his booty pointed with unhesitating
certainty to the noted character of our
narrative. After this depredation in the coach,
with which he came off successful, it would appear
that he bended his course in disguise through the
States of Connecticut and New York, assuming
different characters and committing many robberies
undiscovered and even unsuspected for a length of
time, and afterwards made his appearance in Upper
Canada in the character of a gentleman merchant
from New Brunswick with a large quantity of
smuggled goods from New York, which he said was
coming on after him in wagons. These, he said,
he intended to dispose of on very moderate terms,
so as to suit purchasers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here he called upon my brother, Augustus Bates,
Deputy Postmaster, at Wellington Square, head of
Lake Ontario, and informed the family that he was
well acquainted with Sheriff Bates at Kingston, and
that he called to let them know that he and his
family were well. He regretted very much that he
had not found Mr. Bates at home, and stated that
he was upon urgent and important business and
could not tarry with them for the night, but would
leave a letter for him. This he accordingly did,
properly addressed, and in good handwriting; but
when it was opened, and its contents examined, no
one in the place could make out the name of the
writer, or read any part of the letter! It appeared
to have been written in the characters of some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>foreign language, but it could not be decyphered.
This was another of his characteristic eccentricities,
but his intention in it could not be well understood.</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not appear to make himself particularly
known to the family, nor to cultivate any further
acquaintance with them, but proceeded thence to
the principal boarding house in the town and
engaged entertainments for himself and thirteen
other persons, who, he said, were engaged in
bringing on his wagons, loaded with his smuggled
goods. Having thus fixed upon a residence for
himself and his gang of wagoners, he then called
upon all the principal merchants in the town, on
pretence of entering into contracts for storing large
packages of goods, and promising to give great
bargains to purchasers on their arrival, and in
some instances actually received money as earnest
on some packages of saleable goods, for the sale of
which he entered into contracts. It may be
remarked, by the way, that he wrote also in an
unknown and unintelligible hand to the celebrated
Captain Brant, the same as he had written to
Mr. Bates, but with what view was equally
mysterious and unaccountable.</p>

<p class='c009'>Notwithstanding his genteel and respectable
appearance, there was a singularity in his manner
and conduct which, with all his tact and experience,
he could not altogether conceal, and hence arose
some suspicions as to the reality of his pretensions.
These suspicions received confirmation, and were
soon matured into the reality of his being a genteel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>imposter, from the fact that the time for the arrival
of his wagons was now elapsed, and that they
were not making an appearance. At this juncture,
when public attention and observation were directed
to the stranger to observe which way the balance
would turn, an individual named Brown, who had
formerly resided in New Brunswick, and moved
with his family to Canada, coming into contact
with the gentleman, recognized him from a certain
mark he carried on his face to be the far-famed
Henry More Smith, whom he had seen and known
when in gaol at Kingston.</p>

<p class='c009'>This report passing immediately into circulation,
gave the imposter a timely signal to depart, without
waiting for the arrival of his wagons and
baggage, and without loss of time he took his
departure from Canada, by the way of Lake Erie,
through the Michigan Territory, and down the
Ohio to the Southern States. With his proceedings
during this course of his travels we are entirely
unacquainted; therefore the reader must be left
to his own reflections as to his probable adventures
as he travelled through this immense tract of
country. There is no reason for doubt, however,
that he had by this time, and even long before,
become so confirmed in his iniquitous courses that
he would let no occasion pass unimproved that
would afford him an opportunity of indulging in
the predominant propensity of mind which seemed
to glory in the prosecutions of robberies and
plunder, as well as in the variety of means by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>which he effected his unheard of and unprecedented
escapes.</p>

<p class='c009'>After his arrival in the Southern States, we are
again able to glean something of his life and
history. While he was yet in the gaol at King’s
county, it will be remembered that he said he had
been a preacher, and that he should preach again,
and would gain proselytes; and now his prediction
is brought about, for under a new name, that of
Henry Hopkins, he appeared in the character of a
preacher in the Southern States! And what
wonder? For Satan himself is transformed into
an angel of light. Here, even in this character he
was not without success, for he got many to follow
and admire him; yet deep as his hypocrisy was, he
seemed to be fully sensible of it, although his
conscience had become seared, and was proof
against any proper sense of wrong. He
acknowledged that he had been shocked to see so
many follow him to hear him preach, and even to
be affected under his preaching.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our source of information does not furnish us
with any of the particulars which marked his
conduct while itinerating through the South in his
newly assumed character; yet general accounts
went on to say that he had, for a length of time, so
conducted himself that he gained much popularity
in his ministerial calling, and had a considerable
number of adherents. However, this may have
been the case for a length of time, yet as the
assumption of this new character could not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>attributable to any supernatural impulse, but was
merely another feature of a character already so
singularly diversified, intended as a cloak under
which he might, with less liability to suspicion,
indulge the prevailing and all controlling propensities
of his vitiated mind, it was not to be
expected, with all the ingenuity he was capable of
exercising, that he would long be able to conceal
his real character. Accordingly, some misdemeanor,
which we have not been able to trace, at length
disclosed the hypocrisy of his character, and placed
him before his deluded followers in his true light.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would appear, whatever might have been the
nature of his crime, that legal means were adopted
for his apprehension, and that in order to expedite
his escape from the hands of justice, he had seized
upon a certain gentleman’s coach and horses and
was travelling in the character of a gentleman in
state, when he was overtaken and apprehended in
the State of Maryland. Here he was tried and
convicted, and sentenced to seven years imprisonment
in the state prison in Baltimore, which,
from the nature of the climate, was generally
believed would terminate his career. The particulars
of this adventure I received in the city of
New York in 1827, where I took much pains to
obtain all possible information concerning his
proceedings in the Southern States while passing
under the character of a preacher.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1833 it so happened that I had occasion to
visit the city of New York again, when I renewed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>my enquiries concerning him, but to no effect; no
sources of information to which I had access yielded
any account of him, and the most rational conjecture
was that he either terminated his course in
the state prison at Baltimore, or that one day,
should he outlive the period of his confinement and
be again let loose upon the peace of society, some
fresh development of his character would point out
the scene of his renewed depredations.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this painful state of obscurity I was reluctantly
obliged to leave the hero of our narrative on my
return from New York.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another year had nearly elapsed before any
additional light was thrown upon his history; but
in an unexpected moment, when the supposition of
his having ended his career in the prison at
Baltimore was becoming fixed, I received, by the
politeness of a friend, a file of the <cite>New York
Times</cite>, one of the numbers of which contained
the following article, bringing our adventurer again
full into view in his usual characteristic style:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Police Office—robbery and Speedy Arrest</span>:
A French gentleman from the South, (so represented
by himself), who has for a few weeks past under
the name of Henry Bond, been running up a bill
and running down the fare, at the Francklin House,
was this afternoon arrested at the establishment on
the ungentlemanly charge of pillaging the trunks
of lodgers. Since his sojourn a variety of articles
had disappeared from the chambers of the hotel,
and amongst the rest about two hundred dollars
from the trunk of one gentleman. No one, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>had thought of suspecting the French gentleman,
who was also a lodger, until this morning, when,
unfortunately for him, his face was recognized by a
gentleman who knew him to have been in the state
prison at Baltimore. However, on searching him,
which he readily complied with, not one cent of
the money could be found either upon his baggage
or his person; but in lieu thereof, they found him
possessed of a large number of small keys, through
which, no doubt, he found means of disposing of
any surplus of circulating medium, whereupon
his quarters were changed to Bridewell until the
ensuing term of General Sessions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here he remained in confinement until the period
of his trial came round, when, for want of sufficient
evidence to commit him to the state prison, he was
thence discharged, and the next account we hear of
him brings him before our view under the name of
Henry Preston, arrested in the act of attempting to
rob the Northern Mail Coach, as will appear by the
following article extracted from the <cite>Times</cite>:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Police Office</span>, Monday, Feb. 22nd, 1835—Just
as this office was closing on Saturday evening, a
very gentlemanly looking man, decently dressed,
calling himself Henry Preston, was brought up in
the custody of the driver and guard of the Northern
mail stage who charged him with an attempt to
rob the mail. The accusers testified that within a
short distance of Peekskill they discovered the
prisoner about a hundred yards ahead of the stage,
and on approaching nearer they saw him jump over
a fence, evidently to avoid notice. This, of course,
excited their suspicion, and they kept an eye to the
mail which was deposited in the boot. In the course
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>of a short time the guard discovered the rat nibbling
at the bait, and desiring the driver not to stop the
speed of the horses, he quietly let himself down and
found the prisoner actively employed loosening the
strap which confines the mail-bag! He was
instantly arrested, placed in the carriage and carried
to town free of expense. Having nothing to offer
in extenuation of his offence, Mr. Henry Preston was
committed to Bridewell until Monday for further
investigation.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Police Office</span>, Monday morning—This morning,
Henry Preston, committed for attempting to rob the
Northern Mail, was brought up before the Sitting
Magistrates, when the High Sheriff of Orange
county appeared and demanded the prisoner,
whose real name was Henry Gibney, as a fugitive
from justice? He stated that the prisoner was to
have been tried for grand larceny, and was lodged
in the House of Detention at Newburgh, on
Thursday, under care of two persons—that in the
course of the night he eluded the vigilance
of his keepers, escaped from confinement, and
crossed the river on the ice, and had got down as
far as Peekskill where he says he attempted to get
on top of the stage that he might get into New York
as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>By order of the judges the prisoner was delivered
up to the sheriff of Orange County, to be recognized
there for his trial for the offence with which he
was originally charged, at the next general session
of the Supreme Court. But before the time came
round he had, as on most former occasions, contrived
to make his escape, and directed his course towards
Upper Canada.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Of the particular manner of his escape, and his
adventures on his way through to Canada we can
state nothing with certainty; but like all his
previous movements, we may hazard the conjecture
that they were such as would do the usual honor to
his wretched profession. Yet, with all his tact, he
could not always escape the hands of justice; and
hence his course is not unfrequently interrupted,
and his progress impeded by the misfortunes of the
prison. It is owing to this circumstance that we
are enabled to keep pace with him in Upper Canada,
where we find him confined in the gaol of Toronto
under the charge of burglary.</p>

<p class='c009'>For this information the writer is indebted to
his brother, Mr. Augustus Bates, residing in Upper
Canada. From his letter, dated 4th August, 1835,
we make the following extract, which will point
out the circumstances which have guided us in
endeavoring to follow up the history of the
Mysterious Stranger to the present time:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Dear Brother</span>—I now sit down to acknowledge
the receipt of a number of your letters, especially
your last by Mr. Samuel Nichols, in which you
mentioned that you were writing a new edition of
‘More Smith.’ I have to request that you will
suspend the publication until you hear from me
again. There is a man now confined in Toronto
gaol who bears the description of More Smith, and
is supposed to be the same. Many things are told
of him which no other person could perform. I
will not attempt to repeat them, as I cannot vouch
for their truth. From current reports I was induced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>to write to the sheriff, who had him in charge,
requesting him to give me a correct account of him.
I have not heard from the sheriff since I wrote;
perhaps he is waiting to see in what manner he is
to be disposed of. Report says the man is
condemned to be executed for shop-breaking—he
wishes the sheriff to do his duty; that he had much
rather be hanged than sent to the penitentiary.
Many are the curious stories told of him, which, as
I said before, I will not vouch for. Should the
sheriff write to me, his information may be relied
on.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several communications from Upper Canada
have reached us between the date of the letter from
which the above extract is made and the present
time, but none of them contained the desired
information as to the particular fate of the prisoner,
and the manner in which he was disposed of, until
the 8th of September last, 1836.</p>

<p class='c009'>By a letter from Mr. Augustus Bates, bearing
this date, it would appear that the prisoner had not
been executed, but had been sentenced to one year’s
confinement in the penitentiary. We make the
following extract:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I give you all the information I can obtain
respecting the prisoner enquired after. The gaoler,
who is also the deputy sheriff, that had him in
charge, says he could learn nothing from him;
said he called his name Smith, that he was fifty-five
years old, but denies that he was ever in Kingston,
New Brunswick. The jailer had one of your books
and showed it to him, but he denied any knowledge
of it, and would not give any satisfaction to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>enquiries he made of him. The sheriff says he
believes the person to be the same mysterious
stranger; that he was condemned and sentenced to
the penitentiary for one year. His crime was
burglary.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It would have afforded the writer of these Memoirs
great satisfaction, and, no doubt, an equal satisfaction
to the reader, had it been in his power to have
paid a visit to Upper Canada that he might be able
to state from his own certain and personal
knowledge of the prisoner at Toronto, that he was
indeed the self-same noted individual that was in
his custody twenty-two years ago, and whom he
had the gratification of seeing and recognizing
subsequently at the Simsbury Mines, where he
played off his affected fits with such art and
consequent advantage.</p>

<p class='c009'>But although it is not in the writer’s power to
close up his Memoir with so important and valuable
a discovery—yet, keeping in view the characteristic
features of the man—his professed ignorance of
Kingston in New Brunswick—his denial of ever
having seen the first edition of the Memoirs, and
the care which he took to keep himself enveloped
in mystery, by utterly declining to give any satisfactory
information concerning himself; all these
circumstances united, form a combination of features
so marked as to carry conviction to the mind of the
reader who has traced him through this narrative,
that he is no other than the same mysterious Henry
More Smith.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>There is another feature in the prisoner at Toronto
that seems strangely corroborative of what we are
desirous properly to establish, that is his age. He
acknowledges to be fifty-five years of age, and
although this would make him somewhat older than
his real age, yet it fixes this point—that the
prisoner at Toronto is well advanced in years, and
so must the subject of our Memoirs be also.</p>

<p class='c009'>From information which we have obtained it
seems that he has undergone his trial, and was
committed to the penitentiary for a year’s confinement.
Whether he found any means of effecting
an exemption from labor in the penitentiary and
then reconciling himself to his confinement, or
whether he accomplished one of his ingenious
departures, we are unable to determine. One thing
however, is highly probable—that he is again
going up and down in the earth in the practice of
his hoary-headed villainy, except Power from on
High has directed the arrow of conviction to heart;
for no inferior impulse would be capable of giving
a new direction to the life and actions of a man whose
habits of iniquity have been ripened into maturity
and obtained an immovable ascendancy by the
practice of so many successive years.</p>

<p class='c009'>It must be acknowledged that there is an unprecedented
degree of cleverness in all his adventures,
which casts a kind of illusive and momentary
covering over the real character of his actions, and
would seem to engage an interest in his favor, (and
this is an error to which the human mind seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>remarkable pre-disposed when vice presents itself
before us in all its cleverness), yet who can read
his miserable career without feeling pained at the
melancholy picture of depravity it presents? Who
would have supposed that after his condemnation
and sentence at Kingston, and his life, by an act of
human mercy, given into his hands again, he would
not have hastened to his sorrowing little wife, and
with tears of compunction, mingled with those of
joy, cast himself upon her neck and resolved by a
course of future rectitude and honesty, to make her
as happy as his previous disgraceful and sinful
career had made her miserable.</p>

<p class='c009'>But ah! no. His release was followed by no such
effects. Rendered unsusceptible for every natural
and tender impression, and yet under the full
dominion of the god of this world, he abandoned
the intimate of his bosom, and set out single handed
in the fresh pursuit of crime.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is, however, one redeeming feature which
stands out among the general deformities of his
character. In all the adventures which the history
of his course presents to our view, we are not called
upon to witness any acts of violence and blood; and
it is perhaps owing to the absence of this repulsive
trait of character that we do not behold him in a
more relentless light.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
